CONTENTS
To the Student
This collection of solved problems covers elementary and intermediate calculus, and much of advanced
calculus. We have aimed at presenting the broadest range of problems that you are likely to encounter—the
old chestnuts, all the current standard types, and some not so standard.
Each chapter begins with very elementary problems. Their difficulty usually increases as the chapter pro-
gresses, but there is no uniform pattern.
It is assumed that you have available a calculus textbook, including tables for the trigonometric, logarith-
mic, and exponential functions. Our ordering of the chapters follows the customary order found in many
textbooks, but as no two textbooks have exactly the same sequence of topics, you must expect an occasional
discrepancy from the order followed in your course.
The printed solution that immediately follows a problem statement gives you all the details of one way to
solve the problem. You might wish to delay consulting that solution until you have outlined an attack in your
own mind. You might even disdain to read it until, with pencil and paper, you have solved the problem
yourself (or failed gloriously). Used thus, 3000 Solved Problems in Calculus can almost serve as a supple-
ment to any course in calculus, or even as an independent refresher course.

Solve 3 + 2*<7.
Answer x<2 [Divide both sides by 2. This is equivalent to multiplying by 5.] In interval notation, the
solution is the set (—°°, 2).
Solve 5 - 3* < 5x + 2.
Answer 1 <x [Divide both sides by 8.] In interval notation, the solution is the set (|,°°).
Solve -7<2x + 5<9.
Answer — 6 < x < 2 [Divide by 2.] In interval notation, the solution is the set (—6,2).
Solve 3<4x-l<5.
Answer 1 s x < \ [Divide by 4.] In interval notation, the solution is the set [1, |).
Solve 4<-2x + 5<7.
Answer \ >*>-! [Divide by -2. Since -2 is negative, we must reverse the inequalities.] In interval
notation, the solution is the set [-1, |).
Solve 5 < \x. + 1 s 6.
Answer 12<^sl5 [Multiply by 3.] In interval notation, the solution is the set [12,15].
Solve 2/jc<3.
Case 2. x<0. 2/x<3. 2>3x [Multiply by jr. Reverse the inequality.], |>jc [Divide by 3.] Notice
that this condition |>x is satisfied whenever jc<0. Hence, in the case where x<0, the inequality is
satisfied by all such x.
Answer f < x or x < 0. As shown in Fig. 1-1, the solution is the union of the intervals (1,«) and (—°°, 0).

negative. Case 1. x-3>0 [This is equivalent to x>3.] Multiplying the given inequality (1) by the
positive quantity x-3 preserves the inequality: * + 4<2;t-6, 4<x-6 [Subtract jr.], 10<x [Add
6.] Thus, when x>3, the given inequality holds when and only when x>10. Case 2. x-3<0 [This
is equivalent to x<3]. Multiplying the given inequality (1) by the negative quantity x — 3 reverses the
inequality: * + 4>2*-6, 4>x-6 [Subtract*.], 10>x [Add 6.] Thus, when x<3, the inequality

2x < 4 [Subtract 3 from both sides. This is equivalent to adding -3 to both sides.]
5-3>x<5x + 2, 5<8* + 2 [Add 3x to both sides.], 3<8* [Subtract 2 from both sides.]
-7 < 2* + 5 < 9, -12 < 2x < 4 [Subtract 5 from all terms.]

x may be positive or negative. Case 1. x>0. 2/x<3. 2<3x [Multiply by AC.], |<jc [Divide by 3.]
We cannot simply multiply both sides by x - 3, because we do not know whether x - 3 is positive or

(1) holds when and only when x < 10. But x < 3 implies x < 10, and, therefore, the inequality (1) holds
for all x<3.
Answer *>10 or x<3. As shown in Fig. 1-2, the solution is the union of the intervals (10, oo) and
(~»,3).
x + 5, 0<5 [Subtract x.] This is always true. So, (1) holds throughout this case, that is, wheneverx + 5, 0<5 [Subtract x.] This is always true. So, (1) holds throughout this case, that is, whenever
x>-5. Case 2. x + 5<0 [This is equivalent to x<-5.]. We multiply the inequality (1) by x + 5. The
inequality is reversed, since we are multiplying by a negative number. x>x + 5, 0>5 [Subtract*.] Butinequality is reversed, since we are multiplying by a negative number. x>x + 5, 0>5 [Subtract*.] But
0 > 5 is false. Hence, the inequality (1) does not hold at all in this case.
Answer x > -5. In interval notation, the solution is the set (-5, °°).
2x + 6, -7>x+6 [Subtract x.], -13>x [Subtract 6.] But x<-13 is always false when *>-3.
Hence, this case yields no solutions. Case 2. x + 3<0 [This is equivalent to x<— 3.]. Multiply the
inequality (1) by x + 3. Since x + 3 is negative, the inequality is reversed. x-7<2x + 6, —7<x + 6
[Subtract x.] ~\3<x [Subtract 6.] Thus, when x < —3, the inequality (1) holds when and only when
*>-13.
Answer —13 < x < —3. In interval notation, the solution is the set (—13, —3).
1.11 Solve (2jt-3)/(3;t-5)>3.
7x-15 [Subtract 2x.], I2>7x [Add 15.], T a* [Divide by 7.] So, when x>f, the solutions must
satisfy x<". Case 2. 3x-5<0 [This is equivalent to x<|.]. 2* - 3 < 9* - 15 [Multiply by 3*-5.
Reverse the inequality.], -3<7jr-15 [Subtract 2*.], 12 < 7x [Add 15.], ^ s x [Divide by 7.] Thus,
when x< f, the solutions must satisfy x^ !f. This is impossible. Hence, this case yields no solutions.
Answer f < x s -y. In interval notation, the solution is the set (§, ^].
1.12 Solve (2*-3)/(3*-5)>3.
and x + 3>0. Then x>2 and jt>—3. But these are equivalent to x>2 alone, since x>2 im-and x + 3>0. Then x>2 and jt>—3. But these are equivalent to x>2 alone, since x>2 im-
plies x>-3. Case 2. *-2<0 and A: + 3<0. Then x<2 and jc<—3, which are equivalent to
x<—3, since x<-3 implies x<2.
Answer x > 2 or x < -3. In interval notation, this is the union of (2, °°) and (—<», —3).
1.13 Solve Problem 1.12 by considering the sign of the function f(x) = (x — 2)(x + 3).
one passes through x - — 3, the factor x - 3 changes sign and, therefore, f(x) becomes negative. f(x)
remains negative until we pass through x = 2, where the factor x — 2 changes sign and f(x) becomes and
then remains positive. Thus, f(x) is positive for x < — 3 and for x > 2. Answer

F(x) changes back to being positive. Thus, F(x) is negative for -8 < x < 1. Answer

changes sign and, therefore, H(x) becomes negative again. Finally, when we pass through x = l, x-\

The well-known triangle inequality asserts that |« + U|S|M| + |U|. Prove by mathematical induction that, for
n >2, |u, + H2 + • • • + un\ < |u,| + |uz| + • • • + |M,,|.
The case n = 2 is the triangle inequality. Assume the result true for some n. By the triangle inequality
and the inductive hypothesis,

and, therefore, the result also holds for n + 1.
Prove |M — v\ > | \u\ — \v\ \.
\u\ = \u + (u-v)\^\v\ + \u-v\ [Triangleinequality.] Hence, \u - v\ a \u\ - \v\. Similarly, |i>-u|s

Find a point-slope equation of the line through the points (1, 3) and (3, 6).
The slope m of the given line is (6 - 3)/(3 - 1) = |. Recall that the point-slope equation of the line through
point (x1, y^) and with slope m is y — yt = tn(x — *,). Hence, one point-slope equation of the given line, using
the point (1, 3), is y — 3 = \(x — 1). Answer
Another point-slope equation, using the point (3,6), is y - 6 = \(x — 3). Answer
Write a point-slope equation of the line through the points (1,2) and (1,3).
The line through (1,2) and (1,3) is vertical and, therefore, does not have a slope. Thus, there is no
point-slope equation of the line.
Find a point-slope equation of the line going through the point (1,3) with slope 5.
y -3 = 5(* - 1). Answer
Find the slope of the line having the equation y - 7 = 2(x - 3) and find a point on the line.
y — 7 = 2(x - 3) is a point-slope equation of the line. Hence, the slope m = 2, and (3, 7) is a point on
the line.
Find the slope-intercept equation of the line through the points (2,4) and (4,8).
Remember that the slope-intercept equation of a line is y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the
y-intercept (that is, the v-coordinate of the point where the line cuts the y-axis). In this case, the slope
m = (8-4)7(4-2) =|=2.
Method 1. A point-slope equation of the line is y-8 = 2(* — 4). This is equivalent to y-8 = 2* — 8, or,
finally, to y = 2x. Answer
Method 2. The slope-intercept equation has the form y = 2x + b. Since (2,4) lies on the line, we may
substitute 2 for x and 4 for y. So, 4 = 2-2+6, and, therefore, b = 0. Hence, the equation is y = 2x.
Answer
Find the slope-intercept equation of the line through the points (—1,6) and (2,15).
The slope m = (15 -6)/[2- (-1)] = 1 = 3. Hence, the slope-intercept equation looks like y=3x+b.
Since (-1, 6) is on the line, 6 = 3 • (— \) + b, and therefore, b = 9. Hence, the slope-intercept equation is
y = 3x + 9.
Find the slope-intercept equation of the line through (2, —6) and the origin.
The origin has coordinates (0,0). So, the slope m = (-6 - 0) 1(2 - 0) = -1 = -3. Since the line cuts the
y-axis at (0, 0), the y-intercept b is 0. Hence, the slope-intercept equation is y = -3x.
Find the slope-intercept equation of the line through (2,5) and (—1, 5).
The line is horizontal. Since it passes through (2,5), an equation for it is y=5. But, this is the
slope-intercept equation, since the slope m = 0 and the y-intercept b is 5.

CHAPTER 3
Find the slope and y-intercept of the line given by the equation 7x + 4y = 8.
If we solve the equation Ix + 4y = 8 for y, we obtain the equation y = — \x + 2, which is the
slope-intercept equation. Hence, the slope m = — I and the y-intercept b = 2.
Show that every line has an equation of the form Ax + By = C, where A and B are not both 0, and that,
conversely, every such equation is the equation of a line.
If a given line is vertical, it has an equation x = C. In this case, we can let A = 1 and B = 0. If the
given line is not vertical, it has a slope-intercept equation y = mx + b, or, equivalently, — mx + y = b. So,
let A — — m, 5 = 1, and C = b. Conversely, assume that we are given an equation Ax + By = C, with
A and B not both 0. If B = 0, the equation is equivalent to x= CIA, which is the equation of a vertical
line. If B ^ 0, solve the equation for y:
with slope
Find an equation of the line L through (-1,4) and parallel to the line M with the equation 3x + 4y = 2.
Remember that two lines are parallel if and only if their slopes are equal. If we solve 3x + 4y = 2 for y,
namely, y = —f*+ i, we obtain the slope-intercept equation for M. Hence, the slope of M is — | and,
therefore, the slope of the parallel line L also is -|. So, L has a slope-intercept equation of the form
y=-\x + b. Since L goes through (-1,4), 4= -\ • (-1) + b, and, therefore, fc=4-i="- Thus, the
equation of L is y = - \x + T •
Show that the lines parallel to a line Ax + By = C are those lines having equations of the form Ax + By = E
for some E. (Assume that B =£ 0.)
If we solve Ax + By = C for y, we obtain the slope-intercept equation
-A/B. Given a parallel line, it must also have slope —A/B and, therefore, has a slope-intercept equation
equation Ax + By = E must have slope -A/B (obtained by putting the equation in slope-intercept form) and
is, therefore, parallel to the line with equation Ax + By = C.
Find an equation of the line through (2, 3) and parallel to the line with the equation 4x — 2y = 7.
By Problem 3.13, the required line must have an equation of the form 4x - 2y = E. Since (2, 3) lies on the
line, 4(2) - 2(3) = E. So, £ = 8-6 = 2. Hence, the desired equation is 4x - 2y = 2.
Find an equation of the line through (2,3) and parallel to the line with the equation y = 5.
Since y = 5 is the equation of a horizontal line, the required parallel line is horizontal. Since it passes
through (2, 3), an equation for it is y = 3.
Show that any line that is neither vertical nor horizontal and does not pass through the origin has an equation of
the form
In Problem 3.11, set CIA = a and CIB = b. Notice that, when y = 0, the equation yields the value
x = a, and, therefore, a is the x-intercept of the line. Similarly for the y-intercept.

Find an equation of the line through the points (0,2) and (3,0).
The y-intercept is b = 2 and the ^-intercept is a = 3. So, by Problem 3.16, an equation of the line is
If the point (2, k) lies on the line with slope m = 3 passing through the point (1, 6), find k.
A point-slope equation of the line is y — 6 = 3(x — 1). Since (2, k) lies on the line, k — 6 = 3(2-1).
Hence, k = 9.
Does the point (-1, -2) lie on the line L through the points (4,7) and (5,9)?
The slope of L is (9 - 7)7(5 - 4) = 2. Hence, a point-slope equation of L is y-7 = 2(x- 4). If we
substitute —1 for x and -2 for y in this equation, we obtain —2 — 7 = 2(-l — 4), or —9 = -10, which is
false. Hence, (—1, —2) does not lie on L.
Find the slope-intercept equation of the line M through (1,4) that is perpendicular to the line L with equation
2x - 6y = 5.
Solve 2x - 6y = 5 for y, obtaining y = \x — f. So, the slope of L is j. Recall that two lines with slopes
m1 and m2 are perpendicular if and only if w,w2 = —1, or, equivalently, m, = —1 Im2. Hence, the slope of
M is the negative reciprocal of 3, that is, -3. The slope-intercept equation of M has the form y = -3x + b.
Since (1,4) is on M, 4=—3-1 + fe. Hence, b = 7, and the required equation is y = -3x + 1.
Show that, if a line L has the equation Ax + By - C, then a line M perpendicular to L has an equation of the
form - Bx + Ay = E.
Assume first that L is not a vertical line. Hence, B ^ 0. So, Ax + By — C is equivalent to y =
slope-intercept equation has the form
-Bx + Ay = Ab. In this case, E = Ab. (In the special case when A = 0, L is horizontal and M is vertical.
Then M has an equation x = a, which is equivalent to -Bx = -Ba. Here, E = -Ba and A - 0.) If
L is vertical (in which case, B = 0), M is horizontal and has an equation of the form y = b, which is
equivalent to Ay = Ab. In this case, E = Ab and B = 0.
Find an equation of the line through the point (2, -3) and perpendicular to the line 4x - 5y = 7.
The required equation has the form 5* + 4>' = E (see Problem 3.21). Since (2,—3) lies on the line,
5(2) + 4(-3) = E. Hence, E=~2, and the desired equation is 5x + 4y=-2.
Show that two lines, L with equation A1x + Bly=C1 and M with equation Azx + B2y = C2, are parallel if
and only if their coefficients of x and y are proportional, that is, there is a nonzero number r such that A2 = rA,
and B2 = rBl.
Assume that A2 = rAl and B2 = rBl, with r^O. Then the equation of M is rAtx + rBty = C2,
which is equivalent to A^x + B,}> = - • C2. Then, by Problem 3.13, Mis parallel to L. Conversely, assume M
is parallel to L. By solving the equations of L and M for y, we see that the slope of L is — (A ,/B,) and the slope
of M is ~(A2/B2). Since M and L are parallel, their slopes are equal:
 nr
(In the special case where the lines are vertical, Bl = B2 = 0, and we can set r = A2/A,.)
Determine whether the lines 3x + 6y = 7 and 2x + 4y = 5 are parallel.
The coefficients of x and y are proportional: § = g. Hence, by Problem 3.23, the lines are parallel.

Use slopes to determine whether the points A(4,1), 5(7, 3), and C(3,9) are the vertices of a right triangle.
The slope m1 of line AB is (3 - l)/(7-4) = f. The slope w2 of line BC is (9 -3)/(3 -7) = -f = -|.
Since m2 is the negative reciprocal of m}, the lines AB and BC are perpendicular. Hence, A ABC has a right
angle at B.
Determine k so that the points A(7,5), B(-l, 2), and C(k, 0) are the vertices of a right triangle with right angle at
B.
The slope of line AB is (5-2)/[7-(-1)] = §. The slope of line BC is (2-0)/(-l - *) = -2/(l + it).
The condition for A ABC to have a right angle at B is that lines AB and BC are perpendicular, which holds when
and only when the product of their slopes is —1, that is (|)[—2/(l + k)] = —I. This is equivalent to
6 = 8(1 + *), or 8* = -2, or k=-\.
Find the slope-intercept equation of the line through (1,4) and rising 5 units for each unit increase in x.
Since the line rises 5 units for each unit increase in x, its slope must be 5. Hence, its slope-intercept equation
has the form y = 5x + b. Since (1,4) lies on the line, 4 = 5(l) + b. So, b = — 1. Thus, the equation is
y = 5x-l.
Use slopes to show that the points A(5, 4), B(-4, 2), C(-3, -3), and D(6, -1) are vertices of a parallelogram.
The slope of AB is (4-2)/[5 - (-4)] = | and the slope of CD is [-3 - (-l)]/(-3 -j6) = |; hence,
AB and CD are parallel. The slope of BC is (-3 - 2)/[-3 - (-4)] = -5 and the slope of AD is (-1 - 4)/
(6 — 5) = -5, and, therefore, BC and AD are parallel. Thus, ABCD is a parallelogram.
For what value of k will the line kx + 5y = 2k have ^-intercept 4?
When * = 0, y = 4. Hence, 5(4) = 2*. So, k = 10.
For what value of k will the line kx + 5y - 2k have slope 3?
Solve for y:
A: =-15.
For what value of k will the line kx + 5y = 2k be perpendicular to the line 2x — 3_y = 1?
By the solution to Problem 3.30, the slope of kx + 5y = 2k is —k/5. By solving for y, the slope of
2x — 3y — 1 is found to be |. For perpendicularity, the product of the slopes must be — 1. Hence,
(~fc/5)-i = -1. So, 2k= 15, and, therefore, k=%.
Find the midpoint of the line segment between (2, 5) and (—1, 3).
By the midpoint formula, the coordinates of the midpoint are the averages of the coordinates of the endpoints.
In this case, the midpoint (x, y) is given by ([2 + (-l)]/2, (5 + 3)/2) = (|, 4).
A triangle has vertices A(l,2), B(8,1), C(2,3). Find the equation of the median from A to the midpoint M of

The midpoint M of segment BC is ((8 + 2)/2, (1 + 3)/2) = (5,2). So, AM is horizontal, with equation
y = 2.
For the triangle of Problem 3.33, find an equation of the altitude from B to the opposite side AC.
The slope of AC is (3 - 2)/(2 — 1) = 1. Hence, the slope of the altitude is the negative reciprocal of 1,
namely, —1. Thus, its slope-intercept equation has the form y = — x + b. Since B(8,1) is on the altitude,
1 = -8 + b, and, so, b = 9. Hence, the equation is y = -x + 9.

This is the slope-intercept equation. Hence, the slope m = —k/5 = 3. So,

For the triangle of Problem 3.33, find an equation of the perpendicular bisector of side AB.
The midpoint N of AB is ((1+ 8)/2, (2 +l)/2) = (9/2,3/2). The slope of AB is (2- !)/(!- 8) = -$.
Hence, the slope of the desired line is the negative reciprocal of -7, that is, 7. Thus, the slope-intercept
equation of the perpendicular bisector has the form y = lx + b. Since (9/2,3/2) lies on the line, | =
7(|) + b. So, fe = i - f = -30. Thus, the desired equation is y = Ix - 30.
If a line L has the equation 3x + 2y = 4, prove that a point P(.x, y) is above L if and only if 3x + 2y > 4.
Solving for y, we obtain the equation y=—\x + 2. For any fixed x, the vertical line with that x-coordinate
cuts the line at the point Q where the y-coordinate is —\x + 2 (see Fig. 3-2). The points along that vertical
line and above Q have y-coordinates y>— \x + 2. This is equivalent to 2y>-3* + 4, and thence to
3* + 2y> 4.

Generalize Problem 3.36 to the case of any line Ax + By = C (B^ 0).
Case 1. B > 0. As in the solution of Problem 3.36, a point P(x, y) is above this line if and only if
Ax + By>C. Case 2. B < 0. Then a procedure similar to that in the solution of Problem 3.36 shows that a
point P(x, y) is above this line if and only if Ax + By <C.
Use two inequalities to describe the set of all points above the line L: 4x + 3y = 9 and below the line M:
2x + y = 1.
By Problem 3.37, to be above L, we must have 4* + 3y>9. To be below M, we must have 2x + y<l.

y-axis. («') The slope of BC is — w/v. So, the altitude from A to BC has slope vlw. Its slope-intercept
equation has the form y = (v/w)x + b. Since (M, 0) lies on the line, 0 = (v/w)(u) + b; hence, its y-intercept
b = — vu/w^ Thus, this altitude intersects the altitude from C (the y-axis) at the point (0, -vulw). (Hi) The
slope of AC is —w/u. So, the altitude from B to AC has slope ulw, and its slope-intercept equation is
y = (ulw)x + b. Since (v, 0) lies on the altitude, 0 = (u/w)(v) + b, and its y-intercept b = —uv/w. Thus,
this altitude also goes through the point (0, — vulw).

Refer to Fig. 3-4. Let A be the origin and let B be on the *-axis, with coordinates (v, 0). Let C be (c, e) and
let D be (d, f). The midpoint M, of AB has coordinates (v/2,0), the midpoint_M2 of 1C is ((c + v)/2,
e/2), the midpoint M3 of CD is ((c + d)/2, (e +/)/2), and the midpoint M4 of ~AD is (d/2, f/2).
Slope of line
Thus, MtM2 and M3M4 are parallel. Similarly, the slopes of M2M3 and MjM4 both turn out to be//(d — u), and
therefore M2M3 and M, M4 are parallel. Thus, M1M2M3M4 is a parallelogram. (Note two special cases. When
c = 0, both MjM2 and M3M4 are vertical and, therefore, parallel. When d=v, both MjM4 and M2M3 are
vertical and, therefore, parallel.)

I Choose the jc-axis so that it goes through A and B and let the origin be halfway between A and B. Let A be

the distance formula,
Setting AM1 = BM2 and squaring both sides, we obtain [(3a r c)/2]2 + (d/2)2 = [(3a + c)/2]2 + (d/2)2,
and, simplifying, (3a - c)2 = (3c + c)2. So, (3a + c)2 - (3a - c)2 = 0, and, factoring the left-hand side,
t(3a + c) + (3a - c)] • [(3a + c) - (3a - c)] = 0, that is, (6a) • (2c) = 0. Since a 5^0, c = 0. Now the distance

Find the intersection of the line L through (1, 2) and (5, 8) with the line M through (2,2) and (4, 0).
The slope of L is (8 — 2)/(5 — 1) = |. Its slope-intercept equation has the form y = \x + b. Since it

we find that the equation of M is y = -x + 4. So, we must solve the equations y = -x + 4 and y = \x + \
simultaneously. Then, -x + 4=\x+\, -2x + 8 = 3x + 1, 7 = 5*, x=\. When x=l, y = -x +

equations are y=-\x± 6; that is, 3* + 4y = 24 and 3x + 4y = -24.
A point (x, y) moves so that its distance from the line x = 5 is twice as great as its distance from the line
y = 8. Find an equation of the path of the point.
The distance of (x, y) from x = 5 is |jc-5|, and its distance from y = 8 is |y-8|. Hence,
|x-5|=2|y-8|. So, x - 5 = ±2(y - 8). ' There are two cases: x- 5 = 2(^-8) and x-5=-2(y-8),
yielding the lines x-2y = -ll and * + 2>> = 21. A single equation for the path of the point would
be (x-2y + ll)(x + 2y-2l) = 0.
Find the equations of the lines through (4, —2) and at a perpendicular distance of 2 units from the origin.
A point-slope equation of a line through (4, —2) with slope m is y + 2 = m(x — 4) or mx — y — (4m +
2) = 0. The distance of (0, 0) from this line is |4m + 2| A/m2 + 1. Hence, |4m + 2| /V'm2 + 1 = 2. So,
(4/n + 2)2 = 4(w2 + l), or (2m +1)2 = m2 +1. Simplifying, w(3m + 4) = 0, and, therefore, m = 0 or
OT = - 5. The required equations are y = -2 and 4x + 3y - 10 = 0.

Its slope must be -3. So, its equation has the form y = -3x + b. Then, 1 = —3(5) + b, b = 16.
Thus, the equation is y = —3x + 16.

Since the line y = 1 is horizontal, the desired line must be horizontal. It passes through (0,0), and,
therefore, its equation is y = 0.

The slopes are both 2. Hence, the lines are parallel.

The slope of the first line is 2 and the slope of the second line is - \. Since the product of the slopes is —1, the

Temperature is usually measured either in Fahrenheit or in Celsius degrees. The relation between Fahrenheit
and Celsius temperatures is given by a linear equation. The freezing point of water is 0° Celsius or 32°
Fahrenheit, and the boiling point of water is 100° Celsius or 212° Fahrenheit. Find an equation giving Fahrenheit
temperature y in terms of Celsius temperature *.
Since the equation is linear, we can write it as y — mx + b. From the information about the freezing point
of water, we see that b=32. From the information about the boiling point, we have 212= 100m +32,
180= 100m, m=\. So, y = f* + 32.

Find an equation of the altitude from B to AC.
The slope of ACis (3 - 2)1(5 - 1) = \. Hence, the slope of the altitude is the negative reciprocal -4. So,
the desired equation has the form y = — 4x + b. Since B is on the line, 0 = —32 + b, b = 32. So, the
equation is y = -4* + 32.
Find an equation of the perpendicular bisector of AB.
The slope of AB is (2 —0)/(1 — 8) =-f. Hence, the slope of the desired line is the negative reciprocal \.
The line passes through the midpoint M of AB: M - ( \, 1). The equation has the form y = \x + b. Since
M is on the line, 1 = 5 • f + b, b = -™. Thus, the equation is y = |* - f, or 14* - 4y = 59.

Find the intersection of the lines x - 2y = 2 and 3* + 4y = 6.
We must solve x - 2y = 2 and 3x + 4y = 6 simultaneously. Multiply the first equation by 2, obtaining
2x - 4y = 4, and add this to the second equation. The result is 5x = 10, .v = 2. When x = 2, substitu-
tion in either equation yields y = 0. Hence, the intersection is the point (2, 0).
Find the intersection of the lines 4x + 5y = 10 and 5.v + 4y = 8.

Find the intersection of the line y = 8x - 6 and the parabola y = 2x2.
Solve y = 8x-6 and y = 2x2 simultaneously. 2x2 = 8x - 6, jt2 = 4*--3, *2-4* + 3 = 0,
(x -3)(x- 1) = 0, A-= 3 or x = l. When x = 3, y = 18, and when x=l. y = 2. Thus, the inter-

Find the intersection of the line y = x - 3 and the hyperbola xy = 4.
We must solve y = x - 3 and xy = 4 simultaneously. Then x(x - 3) = 4, x2 - 3x - 4 = 0,
(x-4)(x + l) = 0, x = 4 or x = -l. When .v = 4, y = 1, and when .v=-l, y = -4. Hence, the

Let x represent the number of million pounds of chicken that farmers offer for sale per week, and let y represent

sell x million pounds. Assume also that the demand equation for chicken is y = -0.025* + 2.5, that is,
-0.025* + 2.5 is the price per pound at which consumers are willing to buy x million pounds per week. Find

4.3 Write the standard equation for the circle with center (4, -2) and radius 7.
4.4 Write the standard equation for the circle with center at the origin and radius r.
4.5 Find the standard equation of the circle with center at (1, -2) and passing through the point (7, 4).
The radius of the circle is the distance between (1, -2) and (7, 4):
V72. Thus, the standard equation is: (x - I)2 + (y + 2)2 = 72.
Identify the graph of the equation x2 + y2 - I2x + 20y + 15 = 0.
Complete the square in x and in y: (x - 6)2 + (y + 10)2 + 15 = 36 + 100. [Here the-6 in (x - 6) is half
of the coefficient, -12, of x in the original equation, and the + 10in (_y + 10) is half of the coefficient 20, of y.
The 36 and 100 on the right balance the squares of -6 and +10 that have in effect been added on the left.]
Simplifying, we obtain (x - 6)2 + (y + 10)2 = 121, the standard equation of a circle with center at (6, -10) and
radius 11.
Identify the graph of the equation x2 + y2 + 3x — 2y + 4 = 0.
Complete the square (as in Problem 4.6): (jc + |)2 + (y - I)2 + 4 = j + 1. Simplifying, we obtain
(x + 1 )2 + (y - I)2 = ~ 1. But this equation has no solutions, since the left side is always nonnegative. In
other words, the graph is the empty set.
Identify the graph of the equation x2 + y2 + 2x - 2y + 2 = 0.
Complete the square: (x + I)2 + (y - I)2 + 2 = 1 + 1, which simplifies to (x + I)2 + (y - I)2 = 0. This
is satisfied when and only when * + l=0 and y —1=0, that is, for the point (—1,1). Hence, the graph is

Find the center and radius of the circle passing through the points (3, 8), (9,6), and (13, -2).
By Problem 4.9, the circle has an equation x2 + y2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0. Substituting the values (x, y) at
each of the three given points, we obtain three equations: 3D + 8E + F= -73, 9D + 6E + F= -117,
13D - 2E + F = —173. First, we eliminate F (subtracting the second equation from the first, and subtracting the
third equation from the first):
-10D + 10E = 100 or, more simply -3D+ £ = 22
-D + E = W
Subtracting the second equation from the first, -2D = 12, or D = -6. So, E = 10 + D = 4, and F =
-73-3Z)-8£ = -87. Hence, we obtain x2 + y2 -6x + 4y - 87 = 0. Complete the square: (x - 3)2 +
(y +2)2-87 = 9 + 4, or, (x - 3)2 + (y + 2)2 = 100. Hence, the center is (3,-2) and the radius is VT50 =

Use a geometrical/coordinate method to find the standard equation of the circle passing through the points
A(0, 6), B(12,2), and C(16, -2).
Find the perpendicular bisector of AB. The slope of AB is - j and therefore the slope of the perpendicular
bisector is 3. Since it passes through the midpoint (6, 4) of AB, a point-slope equation for it is y - 4 = 3(,x — 6),
or, equivalently, y = 3x — 14. Now find the perpendicular bisector of BC. A similar calculation yields
y = x - 14. Since the perpendicular bisector of a chord of a circle passes through the center of the circle, the
center of the circle will be the intersection point of y = 3x - 14 and y = x — 14. Setting 3x - 14 = x — 14,
we find x = 0. So, y = x - 14 = —14. Thus, the center is (0,—14). The radius is the distance between the
center (0,-14) and any point on the circle, say (0,6): V(° ~ °)2 + (-14 - 6)2 = V400 = 20. Hence, the
standard equation is x2 + (y + 14)2 = 400.

Let the center be (-12, ft). The distance formula yields 
144+ft2 = 169, b2 = 25, and b = ±5. Hence, there are two circles, with equations (x + 12)2 + (y - 5)2 =

Find the standard equation of the circle passing through (-2, 1) and tangent to the line 3x - 2y - 6 at the point
(4,3).
Since the circle passes through (-2, 1) and (4, 3), its center (a, b) is on the perpendicular bisector of the
segment connecting those points. The center must also be on the line perpendicular to 3x-2y = 6 at (4, 3).
The equation of the perpendicular bisector of the segment is found to be 3x + y = 5. The equation of the line
perpendicular to 3* - 2y = 6 at (4, 3) turns out to be 2x + 3y = 17. Solving 3* + y = 5 and 2* + 3.y =

Find the points of intersection (if any) of the circles x2 + (y -4)2 = 10 and (x — 8)2 + y2 = 50.
The circles are x2 + y2 - 8y + 6 = 0 and x2 - 16* + y2 + 14 = 0. Subtract the second equation from the
first: 16* - 8>> - 8 = 0, 2x-y -1 = 0, y = 2x -1. Substitute this equation for y in the second equation:

equation (x2 + y2 + C^x + D^y + £,) + k(x2 + y2 + C2x + D2y + E2) = 0 yields all circles through the inter-
section points of <£j and ^2 except ^2 itself.
Clearly, the indicated equation yields the equation of a circle that contains the intersection points.
Conversely, given a circle <€ ^ <&, that goes through those intersection points, take a point (xa, ya) of "£ that
does not lie on ^ and substitute x0 for x and y0 for y in the indicated equation. By choice of (*0, y0) the
coefficient of k is nonzero, so we can solve for k. If we then put this value of k in the indicated equation, we
obtain an equation of a circle that is satisfied by (x0, y0) and by the intersection points of <£, and <£2. Since three
noncollinear points determine a circle, we have an equation for (€. {Again, it is the choice of (x0, y0) that makes
the three points noncollinear; i.e., k¥^ -1.]
Find an equation of the circle that contains the point (3,1) and passes through the points of intersection of the two
circles x2 + y2-x-y-2 = Q and x2 + y2 + 4x - 4y - 8 = 0.
g Problem 4.25, substitute (3,1) for (x, y) in the equation (x2 + y2 - x - y - 2) + k(x2 + y2 + 4x -I Using Problem 4.25, substitute (3,1) for (x, y) in the equation (x2 + y2 - x - y - 2) + k(x2 + y2 + 4x -
4y — 8) = 0. Then 4 + Wk = 0, k = — \. So, the desired equation can be written as
Find the equation of the circle containing the point (—2,2) and passing through the points of intersection of the
two circles x2 + y2 + 3x - 2y - 4 = 0 and x2 + y2 - 2x - y - 6 = 0.
Using Problem 4.25, substitute (-2, 2) for (x, y) in the equationx2 + y2 + 3x - 2y - 4) + k(x2 + y2 - 2x -
y — 6) = 0. Then — 6 + 4k = 0, k = \. So, the desired equation is

Determine the locus of a point that moves so that the sum of the squares of its distances from the lines

Let (x, y) be the point. The distances from the two lines are
 Hence,

Find the locus of a point the sum of the squares of whose distances from (2, 3) and (-1, -2) is 34.
Let (x, y) be the point. Then (x -2)2 + (y -3)2 + (x + I)2 + (y + 2)2 = 34. Simplify: x2 + y2 - x -

Find the locus of a point (x, y) the square of whose distance from (-5,2) is equal to its distance from the line

Find a formula for the function f(x) whose graph consists of all points (x, y) such that x2 - 2xy + y2 = 0, and
specify the domain of f(x).
The given equation is equivalent to (x - y)2 = 0, x - y = 0, y = x. Thus, f(x) = x, and the domain is
the set of all real numbers.
In Problems 5.27-5.31, specify the domain and range of the given function.

The domain consists of all real numbers except 2 and 3. To determine the range, set v =
x is in the domain if and only if x2 <1. Thus, the domain is (-1,1). To find the range, first note
that g(x)>0. Then set y = 1 /V1 - x2 and solve for A:, y2 = 1/(1 - x2), x2 = 1 - lly2 >0, lal/y2,
y22:l, ysl. Thus, the range is [1,+00).
The domain is (-1, +00). The graph consists of the open segment from (-1,0) to (1, 2), plus the half line of

fix) = 2x + l.
/(I) = 3 and /(-!)=-!. So, f(x) is neither even nor odd.
Show that a function f(x) is even if and only if its graph is symmetric with respect to the y-axis.
Assume that fix) is even. Let (jc, y) be on the graph of/. We must show that (—x, y) is also on the graph of

on the graph of/. Conversely, assume that the graph of/is symmetric with respect to the _y-axis. Assume that
fix) is defined and f(x) = y. Then (x, y) is on the graph of/. By assumption, (-x, y) also is on the graph of/.
Hence, f(~x) = y. Then, /(-*)=/(*), and fix) is even.
Show that/(*) is odd if and only if the graph of/is symmetric with respect to the origin.
Assume that fix) is odd. Let (x, y) be on the graph of/. Then fix) = y. Since fix) is odd, fi—x) =
—fix) = —y, and, therefore, (—x, -y) is on the graph of /. But, (x, y) and (~x, -y) are symmetric with
respect to the origin. Conversely, assume the graph of / is symmetric with respect to the origin. Assume
fix) = y. Then, (x, y) is on the graph of/. Hence, by assumption, (—x, -y) is on the graph of/. Thus,
fi-x) = — y = -fix), and, therefore, fix) is odd.
Show that, if a graph is symmetric with respect to both the x-axis and the y-axis, then it is symmetric with respect
to the origin.
Assume (x, y) is on the graph. Since the graph is symmetric with respect to the jt-axis, (x, -y) is also on the
graph, and, therefore, since the graph is symmetric with respect to the y-axis, (—x, —y) is also on the graph.
Thus, the graph is symmetric with respect to the origin.
Show that the converse of Problem 5.50 is false.
The graph of the odd function fix) = x is symmetric with respect to the origin. However, (1,1) is on the
graph but (—1,1) is not; therefore, the graph is not symmetric with respect to the y-axis. It is also not symmetric
with respect to the x-axis.
If / is an odd function and /(O) is denned, must /(O) = 0?
Yes. /(0)=/(-0) = -/(0). Hence, /(0) = 0.
If fix) = x2 + kx + 1 for all x and / is an even function, find k.

Show that any function F(x) that is defined for all x may be expressed as the sum of an even function and an odd

Take E(x)= |[F(*) + F(-x)] and O(x) = \[F(x) - F(-x)].
Prove that the representation of F(x) in Problem 5.55 is unique.
If F(x) = E(x) + O(x) and F(x) = E*(x) + O*(x), then, by subtraction,
0 = e(x) + o(x) (1)
where e(x) = E*(x) - E(x) is even and o(x) = O*(x) - O(x) is odd. Replace x by -x in (1) to obtain

f(x) = x2 for all x.

f(x) = - for all nonzero x.
f(x) = \x\ for all x.
/(—I) = 1 = /(I). Hence, /is not one-one.
f(x) = [x] for all x.
/(O) = 0 = /(|). Hence, /is not one-one.
f(x) = x3 for all x.

f(x) = x + 4.

Prove algebraically that a real number x has a unique cube root.
Suppose there were two cube roots, u and i>, so that u3 = i>3 = x, or u3 - v3 = 0. Then, by Problem

Unless both u and v are zero, the factor in brackets is positive (being a sum of squares); hence the other factor

If f(x) — (x + 3)(x + k), and the remainder is 16 when f(x) is divided by x ~ 1, find k.

f(x) = (x-2)q(x) + 2&. Hence, /(2) = 28. But, f(2) = (2 + 5)(2 - k) = 7(2 - k). So, 2 - it = 4,
k= -2.
If the zeros of a function f(x) are 3 and -4, what are the zeros of the function g(x) =/(jt/3)?
/(jt/3) = 0 if and only if x/3 = 3 or */3=-4, that is, if and only if * = 9 or x=-12.
Describe the function f(x) = |jt| + j* — 1| and draw its graph.
Case 1. jcsl. Then /(*) = * + *-1 =2x - 1. Case 2. Os * < 1. Then f(x) = x - (x ~ l)= \.
Case 3. Jt<0. Then /(*)= -x - (x - 1) = -2x + 1. So, the graph (Fig. 5-25) consists of a horizontal line
segment and two half lines.

Find the domain and range of f(x) = V5 — 4x - x2.
ompleting the square, x2 + 4x - 5 = (x + 2)2 - 9. So, 5 - 4x - x2 = 9 - (x + 2)2. For the functionI By completing the square, x2 + 4x - 5 = (x + 2)2 - 9. So, 5 - 4x - x2 = 9 - (x + 2)2. For the function
to be defined we must have (x + 2)2s9, -3==* +2s3, -5<*sl. Thus, the domain is [-5,1]. For*
in the domain, 9 > 9 - (x + 2)2 > 0, and, therefore, the range will be [0,3].
Show that the product of two even functions and the product of two odd functions are even functions.
If / and g are even, then f(~x)-g(-x) = f(x)-g(x). On the other hand, if / and g are odd, then

Show that the product of an even function and an odd function is an odd function.
Let /be even and g odd. Then f(-x)-g(-x) =/(*)• [-g«] = -f(x)-g(x).
Prove that if an odd function f(x) is one-one, the inverse function g(y) is also odd.
Write y=f(*)', then * = g(}') and, by oddness, f(~x)=—y, or —x — g(—y). Thus, g(—y) =

Show geometrically that when the graph of a one-one function is reflected in the 45° line y = x, the result is the

It is evident from Fig. 5-26 that right triangles ORP and OR'P' are congruent. Hence,
Thus the locus of P' is the graph of x as a function of y; i.e., of x = f~i(y). Note that because y = f(x)
meets the horizontal-line test (/being one-one), x = f~(y) meets the vertical-line test.

Assume e>0. We wish to find 5 >0 so that, if \x-4\<8, then \(2x-5) -3|< e. But,
(2x-5)-3 = 2x-8 = 2(x-4). Thus, we must have |2(x-4)|<e, or, equivalently, |*-4|<e/2. So, it
suffices to choose 8 = c/2 (or any positive number smaller than e/2).
In an e-S proof of the fact that lim (2'+ 5x) = 17, if we are given some e, what is the largest value of 5 that can
be used?
5 must be chosen so that, if |*-3|<S, then \(2 + 5x) -17| <e. But, (2 + 5*)-17 = 5*-15=
5(*-3). So, we must have \5(x-3)\<e, or, equivalently, |*-3|<e/5. Thus, the largest suitable value
of 5 would be el5.

6.28 Find any vertical and horizontal asymptotes of the graph of the function f(x) = (4x - 5) /(3x + 2).
Remember that a vertical asymptote is a vertical line x = c to which the graph gets closer and closer as x
approaches c from the right or from the left. Hence, we obtain vertical asymptotes by setting the denominator
3x + 2 = 0. Thus, the only vertical asymptote is the line x=-\. Recall that a horizontal asymptote is a line
y = d to which the graph gets closer and closer as x—»+«> or x—»—«. In this case,
Thus, the line y = § is a horizontal asymptote both on the right and the left.
6.29 Find the vertical and horizontal asymptotes of the graph of the function f(x) = (2x + 3) Nx2 - 2x - 3.
x2 — 2x — 3 = (x — 3)(x + 1). Hence, the denominator is 0 when x = 3 and when x = — 1. So, those
lines are the vertical asymptotes. (Observe that the numerator is not 0 when x — 3 and when x — — 1.) To
obtain horizontal asymptotes, we compute
divide numerator and denominator by A:. The first limit becomes
6.30 Find the vertical and horizontal asymptotes of the graph of the function f(x) = (2x + 3) /Vx2 - 2x + 3.
Completing the square: x2 — 2x + 3 = (x — I)2 + 2. Thus, the denominator is always positive, and there-
fore , there are no vertical asymptotes. The calculation of the horizontal asymptotes is essentially the same as that
in Problem 6.29; y = 2 is a horizontal asymptote on the right and y = — 2 a horizontal asymptote on the
left.

So, there are no vertical asymptotes. To find out whether there is a horizontal asymptote, we compute
lim VTTT - Vx:
Thus, y = 0 is a horizontal asymptote on the right.
Find the vertical and horizontal asymptotes of the graph of the function /(*) = (x2 - 5x + 6) /(x - 3).
x2 - 5x + 6 = (x - 2)(x - 3). So, (x2 - 5x + 6)l(x - 3) = x - 2. Thus, the graph is a straight line =

Since there are both rational and irrational numbers arbitrarily close to a given number c, lim f(x) does not
exist. Hence, f(x) is discontinuous at all points.
7.14 Determine the points of discontinuity (if any) of the following function f(x).
Le
t c be any number. Since there are irrational numbers arbitrarily close to c, f(x) = 0 for values of x
arbitrarily close to c. Hence, if lim f(x) exists, it must be 0. Therefore, if f(x) is to be continuous at c, we
must have /(c) = 0. Since there are rational numbers arbitrarily close to c, f(x) = x for some points that are
arbitrarily close to c. Hence, if lim f(x) exists, it must be lim;e = c. So, if /(*) is continuous at c,
/(c) = c = 0. The only point at which f(x) is continuous is x = 0.
7.15 (a) Let f(x) be a continuous function such that f(x) = 0 for all rational x. Prove that f(x) = 0 for all x.
(b) Letf(x) and g(x) be continuous functions such that f(x) = g(x) for all rational x. Show that f(x) = g(x)
for all x.
(a) Consider any real number c. Since f(x) is continuous at c, lim f(x) = f(c). But, since there are
rational numbers arbitrarily close to c, f(x) = 0 for values of x arbitrarily close to c, and, therefore,
lim f(x) = 0. Hence, /(c) = 0. (b) Let h(x) = f(x) - g(x). Since f(x) and g(x) are continuous, so is h(x).
Since f(x) = g(x) for all rational*, h(x) = 0 for all rational*, and, therefore, by part (a), h(x) = 0 for all
x. Hence, f(x) = g(x) for all x.
7.16 Letf(x) be a continuous function such that f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y) for all* andy. Prove that f(x) = ex for
some constant c.
Let /(I) = c. (i) Let us show by induction that f(n) = en for all positive integers n. When n = 1,
this is just the definition of c. Assume f(n) = cn for some n. Then f(n + 1) =f(n) + /(!) = en + c =
c(n + l). (ii) /(0)=/(0 + 0)=/(0)+/(0). So, /(0) = 0 = c-0. (Hi) Consider any negative integer -n,
where n >0. Then, 0 = /(0) =/(n + (-n)) =/(n)+/(-«). So, f(-n)=-f(n)=-cn = c(-n). (iv)

Find the discontinuities (if any) of the function f(x) such that f(x) = 0 for x = 0 or x irrational, and
f(x) = — when x is a nonzero rational number —, n > 0, and — is in lowest terms (that is, the integers mn n nand n have no common integral divisor greater than 1).
Casel. c is rational. Assume f{x) is continuous ate. Since there are irrational numbers arbitrarily close to
c> /M = 0 for values of * arbitrarily close to c, and, therefore, by continuity, /(c) = 0. By definition of /, c
cannot be a nonzero rational. So, c = 0. Now, f(x) is in fact continuous at x = Q, since, as rational
numbers m/n approach 0, their denominators approach +°°, and, therefore, /(m/n) = 1 In approaches 0, which
is /(O). Case 2. c is irrational. Then /(c) = 0. But, as rational numbers m/n approach c, their de-
nominators n approach +<*>, and, therefore, the values /(m/n) = 1 In approach 0 = /(c). Thus, any irration-
al number is a point of continuity, and the points of discontinuity are the nonzero rational numbers.

Let/(jc) be a continuous function from the closed interval [a, b] into itself. Show that/(x) has a fixed point, that
is, a point x such that f(x) = x.
If /(a) = a or f(b) = b, then we have a fixed point. So, we may assume that a<f(a) and f(b)<b
(Fig. 7-7). Consider the continuous function h(x) = f(x) - x. Recall the Intermediate Value theorem: Any
continuous function h(x) on [a, b] assumes somewhere in [a, b] any value between h(a) and h(b). Now,
h(a) = f(a) — a > 0, and h(b) = f(b) - b < 0. Since 0 lies between /j(a) and h(b), there must be a point c in
[a, b] such that fc(c) = 0. Hence, /(c) - c = 0, or /(c) = c.
7.21 Assume that f(x) is continuous at x = c and that f(c) > 0. Prove that there is an open interval around c on
which f(x) is positive.
Let e=/(c). Since lim/(*) =/(c), there exists 8 > 0 such that, if \x-c\<8, then \f(x)-f(c)\<
e = /(c). So, -/(c)</(jc)-/(c)</(c). By the left-hand inequality, /(x)>0. This holds for all * in the
open interval (c - 8, c + S).
7.22 Show that the function f(x) = 2x3 - 4x2 + 5x - 4 has a zero between x = I and x = 2.
(*) is continuous, /(!)=-!, and /(2) = 6. Since /(l)<0</(2), the Intermediate Value theorem
implies that there must be a number c in the interval (1,2) such that /(c) = 0.
7.23 Verify the Intermediate Value theorem in the case of the function f(x) =

/(-4) = 0> /(0) = 4, /is continuous on [-4,0], and 0<V7<4. We must find a number c in [-4, 0] such

When x = 3, f(x) - 45. So, the point is (3,45). Recall that the slope of the tangent line is the derivative
/'(*), evaluated for the given value of x. But, /'(*) = 12x2 - Ux. Hence, /'(3) = 12(9) - 14(3) = 66.
Thus, the slope-intercept equation of the tangent line has the form y = 66x + b. Since the point (3,45) is on
the tangent line, 45 = 66(3) + 6, and, therefore, b = -153. Thus, the equation is v=66*-153.

8.14 At what point(s) of the graph of y = x5 + 4x - 3 does the tangent line to the graph also pass through the point
5(0,1)?
The derivative is y' = 5x4 + 4. Hence, the slope of the tangent line at a point A(xa, y0) of the graph is
5*o + 4. The line AB has slope So, the line AB is the tangent line if and
only if (x0 + 4x0 - 4) Ix0 = 5x1 + 4- Solving, x0 = — 1. So, there is only one point (—1, —8).
8.15 Specify all lines through the point (1, 5) and tangent to the curve y = 3>x3 + x + 4.
y' = 9x2 + l. Hence, the slope of the tangent line at a point (xa, ya) of the curve is 9*0 + 1. The slope of
the line through (x0, y0) and (1,5) is So, the tangent line passes
through (1,5) if and only if = 9x20 + l, 3*2 + jr0-l = (je0-l)(9*S + l), 3x30 + x0-l=9x30-
9**+ *„-!, 9*0 = 6*0, 6*o-9*o = 0, 3*0(2*0 - 3) = 0. Hence, *0 = 0 or *0=|, and the points on
the curve are (0, 4) and (§, ^). The slopes at these points are, respectively, 1 and f. So, the tangent lines are
y — 4 = x and y — *TT = T(X—%), or, equivalently, y = x + 4 and y=SfX— ".
8.16 Find the slope-intercept equation of the normal line to the graph of y = jc3 — x2 at the point where x = l.
The normal line is the line perpendicular to the tangent line. Since y' = 3x2 — 2x, the slope of the tangent
lineal x = 1 is 3(1)2 - 2(1) = 1. Hence, the slope of the normal line is the negative reciprocal of 1, namely
— 1. Thus, the required slope-intercept equation has the form y = —x + b. On the curve, when x = \,
y = (I)3 - (I)2 = 0. So, the point (1,0) is on the normal line, and, therefore, 0 = -1 + b. Thus, b = \,
and the required equation is y = — x + 1.

If the line 4x-9_y = 0 is tangent in the first quadrant to the graph of y = \x + c, what is the value of c9
y' = x2 If we rewrite the equation 4x-9y = 0 as y = l,x, we see that the slope of the line is §
Hence, the slope of the tangent line is 5, which must equal the derivative x2 So, x = ± I Since the point of
tangency is in the first quadrant, x = 3 The corresponding point on the line has y-coordmate \ = gx =

Find the points on the curve where the tangent line is parallel to the line y = 3x.
y' = x2-l is the slope of the tangent line. To be parallel to the line y=3x having slope 3, it also must

Find the derivative of the function f(x) = (2x — 3)2.
I f(x) = 4x2 - 12* + 9. Hence, /'(*) = 8* - 12. [Notice that the same method would be difficult to carry
out with a function like (2x - 3)20.]
Where does the normal line to the curve y = x — x2 at the point (1,0) intersect the curve a second time?
I y' = l~2x. The tangent line at (1,0) has slope 1—2(1) = —!. Hence, the normal line has slope 1, and a
point-slope equation for it is y = x-l. Solving y = x - x2 and y = x - 1 simultaneously, x - x2 =
x — I, x2 = 1, x = ±1. Hence, the other point of intersection occurs when x = — 1. Then y = x — 1 =
-1 - 1 = -2. So, the other point is (-1, -2).
Find the point(s) on the graph of y = x2 at which the tangent line is parallel to the line y — 6x — 1.
I Since the slope of y = 6x — 1 is 6, the slope of the tangent line must be 6. Thus, the derivative 2x = 6,
x = 3. Hence, the desired point is (3,9).
Find the point(s) on the graph of y = x3 at which the tangent line is perpendicular to the line 3x + 9y = 4.
I The equation of the line can be rewritten as _y = -jx+5, and so its slope is - j. Hence, the slope of the
required tangent line must be the negative reciprocal of -1, namely, 3. So, the derivative 3x2 = 3, x2 = 1,
x = ±1. Thus, the solutions are (1,1) and (—1, —1).
Find the slope-intercept equation of the normal line to the curve y = x3 at the point at which x = |.
I The slope of the tangent line is the derivative 3x2, which, at x = |, is 5. Hence, the slope of the normal
line is the negative reciprocal of 5, namely, -3. So, the required equation has the form y = —3x + b. On
the curve, when x=\, y = x3 = TJ . Thus, the point (|, ^) lies on the line, and j? = -3(3) + fe, 6= if.
So, the required equation is y = —3x + ff.
At what points does the normal line to the curve y = x2 - 3x + 5 at the point (3, 5) intersect the curve?
I The derivative 2x — 3 has, at x = 3, the value 3. So, the slope of the normal line is - 3, and its
equation is y = — 3* + b. Since (3, 5) lies on the line, 5 = — 1 + b, or b = 6. Thus, the equation of the
normal line is y = — jx + 6. To find the intersections of this line with the curve, we set — jjc + 6 =
x2-3x + 5, 3x2-8x-3 = 0, (3x + l)(x - 3) = 0, x = -\ or * = 3. We already know about the point

8.38 Find the point(s) on the graph of y = x2 at which the tangent line passes through (2, —12).
The slope of the tangent line is the derivative 2x. Since (x, x2) and (2, -12) lie on the tangent line, its
slope is (x2 + 12) l(x - 2). Hence, (x2 + 12) /(x - 2) = 2x, X2 + 12 = 2x2 -4x, x2 - 4* - 12 = 0, (x - 6)(x +

Let /(*) = 3x3 — llx2 — 15x + 63. Find all points on the graph of/where the tangent line is horizontal.
The slope of the tangent line is the derivative f'(x) = 9x -22*-15. The tangent line is horizontal when
and only when its slope is 0. Hence, we set 9x2 - 22x - 15 = 0, (9* + 5)(* - 3) = 0, x-3 or *=-!.
Thus, the desired points are (3,0) and
8.43 Determine the points at which the function f(x) = \x - 3| is differentiable.

10.2 Give the equations relating degree measure and radian measure of angles.
I 2-rr radians is the same as 360 degrees. Hence, 1 radian = 180/Tr degrees, and 1 degree = 77/180
radians. So, if an angle has a measure of D degrees and/? radians, then D = (180/7r).R and R = (77/180)D.
10.3 Give the radian measure of angles of 30°, 45°, 60°, 90°, 120°, 135°, 180°, 270°, and 360°.
I We use the formula R = (?r/180)D. Hence 30° = 77/6 radians, 45° = 77/4 radians, 60° = 77/3 radians,
90° = 77/2 radians, 120° = 27T/3 radians, 135° = 377/4 radians, 180° = 77 radians, 270° = 377/2 radians,
360° = 277 radians.
10.4 Give the degree measure of angles of 377/5 radians and 577/6 radians.
I We use the formula D = (180 ITT)R. Thus, 377/5 radians = 108° and 577/6 radians = 150°.
10.5 In a circle of radius 10 inches, what arc length along the circumference is intercepted by a central angle of 77/5
radians?
I The arc length s, the radius r, and the central angle 6 (measured in radians) are related by the equation
s = r6. In this case, r = 10 inches and 0 = 77/5. Hence, 5 = 277 inches.
10.6 If a bug moves a distance of 377 centimeters along a circular arc and if this arc subtends a central angle of 45°, what
is the radius of the circle?
I s = rO. In this case, s = 3ir centimeters and 0 = 77/4 (the radian measure equivalent of 45°). Thus,
377 = r • 77/4. Hence, r = 12 centimeters.
10.7 Draw a picture of the rotation determining an angle of -77/3 radians.
I See Fig. 10-2. 77/3 radians = 60°, and the minus sign indicates that a 60° rotation is to be taken in the
clockwise direction. (Positive angles correspond to counterclockwise rotations.)

Because cos 3(* + 2tr/3) = cos (3>x + 2ir) = cos 3x, the function is of period p = 2ir/3. Hence, the
length of each wave is 277/3. The number/of waves over an interval of length 2ir is 3. (In general, this number

10.23 Find an equation of the normal line to the curve y = 1 + cos x at the point
The slope of the tangent line is the derivative y'. But, y' = -sin x = -sin (ir/3) = -V3/2. Hence, the
slope of the normal line is the negative reciprocal 2A/3. So a point-slope equation of the normal line is
y - \ = (2/V3)(x - IT/3) = (2V3/3)jc - 27rV3/9.

Remember that tan x = sin AT/COS x and sec x = 1 /cos x. By the quotient rule,
10.25 Find an equation of the tangent line to the curve y = tan2 x at the point (7r/3,3).
Note that tan (ir/3) = sin(7j-/3)/cos (w/3) = (V3/2)/i = V3, and sec(ir/3) = l/cos(ir/3) = 1/| =2. By
the chain rule, / = 2(tanx)- -7- (tan*) = 2(tan*)(sec2 *). Thus, when x = ir/3, y' =2V5-4 = 8V5, so
the slope of the tangent line is 8V3. Hence, a point-slope equation of the tangent line is y — 3 = 8V3(x - ir/3).

10.29 Find Dx
By the chain rule, y' = 3[2 sec x • -r- (sec x)] = 3(2 sec x • sec x • tan x) = 6 sec2 x tan x. So the slope of the
tangent line is y' = 6(f)(V3/3) = 8V3/3. Hence, the slope of the normal line is the negative reciprocal
-V3/8. Thus, a point-slope equation of the normal line is y - 4 = -(V3/8)(x - 77/6).

Hence,
10.32 Show that the curve y = xsin* is tangent to the line y = x whenever x = (4n + l)(ir/2), where n is any
integer.
When x = (4n +l)(ir/2)= TT/2 + 2irn, sin * = sin ir/2 = 1, cos x = cos ir/2 = 0, and xsinx = x.
Thus, at such points, the curve y = *sin* intersects y = x. For y = *sinjc, y' = x • Dx(sm x) + sin x-
Df(x) = x cos A; + sin x. Thus, at the given points, y' = x • 0 + 1 = 1. Hence, the slope of the tangent line to
the curve y = jcsinx at those points is 1. But the slope of the line y = x is also 1, and, therefore, y = *
is the taneent line.
10.33 At what values of x does the graph of y = sec x have a horizontal tangent?
I A line is horizontal when and only when its slope is 0. The slope of the tangent line is y' = D^sec x) =
sec ;t tan*. Hence, we must solve sec*tan* = 0. Since sec x = 1 /cos x, sec* is never 0. Hence,
tan* = 0. But, since tan x = sin* /cos-*, tan* = 0 is equivalent to sin* = 0. The latter occurs when and
only when x = nir for some integer n.
10.34 For what values of x are the tangent lines to the graphs of y = sin x and y = cos x perpendicular?
I The tangent line to the graph of y = sin x has slope D^(sin x) = cos x, and the tangent line to the
graph of >> = cosx has slope D^(cos x) = -sin x. Hence, the condition for perpendicularity is that
cos x • (-sin x) = -1, which is equivalent to cos x sin x = 1. Since 2 cos x sin x — sin 2x, this is equivalent to
sin 2x = 2, which is impossible, because |sin jr| :£ 1 for all x. Hence, there are no values of x which satisfy
the property.
10.35 Find the angle at which the curve y = 3 sin 3x crosses the x-axis.
I The curve crosses the x-axis when y = | sin 3x = 0, which is equivalent to sin 3x = 0, and thence
to 3x = ntr, where n is an arbitrary integer. Thus, x = mr/3. The slope of the tangent line is
y' = 3 cos 3x • 3 = cos 3x = cos (mr) = ±1. The lines with slope ±1 make an angle of ±45° with the x-axis.

Rolle's Theorem,

11.1 State Rolle's theorem.
f If / is continuous over a closed interval [a, b] and differentiable on the open interval (a, b), and if
/(a) = f(b) = 0, then there is at least one number c in (a, b) such that f'(c) = 0.
In Problems 11.2 to 11.9, determine whether the hypotheses of Rolle's theorem hold for the function/on the
given interval, and, if they do, verify the conclusion of the theorem.
11.2 f(x) = x2 - 2x - 3 on [-1,3].
I f(x) is clearly differentiable everywhere, and /(-I) =/(3) = 0. Hence, Rolle's theorem applies. /'(*) =
2x-2. Setting /'(*) = °> we obtain x = l. Thus, /'(1) = 0 and -KK3.
11.3 /(*) = x" - x on [0,1].
I f(x) is differentiable, with /'(*) = 3*2 -1. Also, /(0)=/(1) = 0. Thus, Rolle's theorem applies.
Setting /'(*) = 0, 3x2 = 1, x2 = 5, x = ±V5/3. The positive solution x = V5/3 lies between 0 and 1.
11.4 f(x) = 9x3-4x on [-§,§].
I f'(x) = 27x2-4 and /(-§ )=/(§) = 0. Hence, Rolle's theorem is applicable. Setting f'(x) = 0,
27x2 = 4, x2=£, * = ±2/3V3 = ±2V3/9. Both of these values lie in [-§, |], since 2V5/9<§.
11.5 /(*) = *3 - 3*2 + * + 1 on[l, 1 + V2].
I /'(*) = 3x2 - 6^ + 1 and /(I) =/(! + V2) = 0. This means that Rolle's theorem applies. Setting
f'(x) = 0 and using the quadratic formula, we obtain x = l±^V6 and observe that 1< 1 + jV~6< 1 + V2.

f(x) is differentiable within (0,8), but not at 0. However, it is continuous at x = 0 and, therefore,
throughout [0,8]. Also, /(0)=/(8) = 0. Hence, Rolle's theorem applies. /'(*) = 2/3v^-2/3(vT)2.
Setting f'(x) = 0, we obtain x = 1, which is between 0 and 8.
Notice that x3 -2x2 -5x + 6 = (x - l)(x2 - x -6). Hence, f(x) = x2 - x - 6 if x¥=l and x is in
[-2,3]. But /(*) = -6 = x2 - x - 6 when x = l. So f(x) = x2-x-6 throughout the interval [-2, 3].
Also, note that /(-2) =/(3) = 0. Hence, Rolle's theorem applies. f'(x) = 2x-l. Setting f'(x) = 0, we
obtain x = 5 which lies between —2 and 3.

11.18 f(x) = 3x + l.
f'(x) = 3. Hence, f(x) is increasing everywhere.
In Problems 11.18 to 11.26, determine where the function/is increasing and where it is decreasing.
11.17 Prove that, if f'(x)>0 for all x in the open interval (a, b), then f(x) is an increasing function on (a, b).
Assume a<u<v<b. Then the mean value theorem applies to f(x) on the closed interval (u, v). So, for
some c between u and v, f'(c) = [f(v) - /(«)] /(v - u). Hence, f(v) - /(«) = f'(c)(v - u). Since u<v,
v-u>0. By hypothesis, /'(c)>0. Hence, f(v) -/(«)>0, and /(u) >/(«). Thus,/(A:) is increasing
in (a, ft).

11.19 f(x) = -2x + 1.
I f'(x) = —2 <0. Hence, f(x) is always decreasing.
11.20 f(x) = x2-4x + 7.
I f'(x) = 2x-4. Since 2x-4>Q**x>2, f(x) is increasing when x>2. Similarly, since 2x-4<
0 <-» * < 2, f(x) is decreasing when x<2.
11.21 f(x) = 1 - 4x - x2.
1 f'(x)=-4-2x. Since -4- 2x>Q++x< -2, f(x) is increasing when x<-2. Similarly, f(x) is de-
creasing when x > —2.
11.22 /(*) = Vl - x2.
f(x) is denned only for -1<*<1. Now, f'(x) = -xNl - x2. So, f(x) >Q**x <0. Thus, /(*) is
increasing when -1< x < 0. Similarly, f(x) is decreasing when 0 < x < 1.
11.23
I f(x) is defined only when -3<x<3. f'(x)= \(-x)N 9 - x2. So, /'(*)> 0«-»*<0. Thus, f(x) is
increasing when — 3<;t<0 and decreasing when 0<Ac<3.
11.24 f(x) = x3- 9x2 + 15x - 3.
I f'(x) = 3x2-l8x + 15 = 3(x-5)(x- 1). The key points are x = l and * = 5. f'(x)>Q when jc>5,
/'(AC)<O for Kx<5, and /'(AC)>O when x<l. Thus, /(*) is increasing when x<\ or x>5,
and it is decreasing when 1 < x < 5.
11.25 f(x) = x + l/x.
I f(x) is denned for x^O. f'(x) = \-(\lx2). Hence, /'(*)<O-H>!< l/x\ which is equivalent to x2 <l.
Hence, f(x) is decreasing when — 1<AC<0 or 0<x<l, and it is increasing when AC>! or AC<—1.
11.26 f(x) = x3- \2x + 20.
I f'(x) = 3x2 — l2 = 3(x — 2)(x + 2). The key points are x = 2 and x = —2. For Ac>2, f'(x)>0; for
-2<Ac<2, f'(x)<0; for jc<-2, f'(x)>Q. Hence, f(x) is increasing when x>2 or x<-2, and it
is decreasing for -2 < x < 2.
11.27 Let f(x) be a differentiable function such that f'(x)^0 for all AC in the open interval (a, b). Prove that there is
at most one zero of f(x) in (a, b).
I Assume that there exist two zeros u and v off(x) in (a, b) with u<v. Then Rolle's theorem applies to /(AC)
in the closed interval [u, v]. Hence, there exists a number c in (u, v) such that f'(c) = 0. Since a<c<b,
this contradicts the assumption that f'(x)^0 for all x in (a, b).
11.28 Consider the polynomial f(x) = 5x3 - 2x2 + 3x-4. Prove that f(x) has a zero between 0 and 1 that is the only
zero of/(AC).
I /(0)=-4<0, and /(1) = 2>0. Hence, by the intermediate value theorem, f(x) = 0 for some x between
0 and 1. /'(*) = 15AC2 - 4AC -I- 3. By the quadratic formula, we see that/'(*) has no real roots and is, therefore,
always positive. Hence, f(x) is an increasing function and, thus, can take on the value 0 at most once.
11.29 Let/(AC) and g(x) be differentiable functions such that /(a)sg(a) and f'(x)> g'(x) for all x. Show that
f(x) > g(x) for all x > a.
1 The function h(x) = f(x) - g(x) is differentiable, /*(«)>0, and h'(x)>0 for all x. By the latter
condition, h(x) is increasing, and, therefore, since /i(«)>0, h(x)>0 for all AC > a. Thus, /M>g(Ac)
for all AC > a.

By the mean value theorem, there is a number c between 27 and 125 such that
11.31 Show that g(*) = Bx3 - 6x2 - 2x + 1 has a zero between 0 and 1.
Notice that the intermediate value theorem does not help, since g(0) = 1 and g(l) = l. Let f(x) =
2x4 -2x3-x2 + x and note that /'(*) = g(x). Since /(O) = /(I) = 0, Rolle's theorem applies to /(*) on
the interval [0,1]. Hence, there must exist c between 0 and 1 such that f'(c) = 0. Then g(c) = 0.
11.32 Show that x + 2x - 5 = 0 has exactly one real root.
Let f(x) = x3 + 2x - 5. Since /(0)=-5<0 and /(2)=7>0, the intermediate value theorem tells us
that there is a root of f(x) = 0 between 0 and 2. Since f'(x) = 3x2 + 2 > 0 for all x, f(x) is an increasing
function and, therefore, can assume the value 0 at most once. Hence, f(x) assumes the value 0 exactly once.
11.33 Suppose that f(x) is differentiable every where, that /(2) =-3, and that !</'(*)< 2 if 2<x<5. Show
that 0</(5)<3.
By the mean value theorem, there exists a c between 2 and 5 such that So,
Since 2<c<5, K/'(c)<2, 3<3/'(c)<6, 3</(5) + 3<6,
11.34 Use the mean value theorem to prove that tan x > x for 0 < x < Tr/2.
The mean value theorem applies to tan* on the interval [0, x]. Hence, there exists c between 0 and x
such that sec2 c = (tan* - tanO)/(*-0) = tan*/*. [Recall that Dx(tan *) = sec2 *.] Since 0<c<7r/2,
0 < cos c < 1, sec c > 1, sec2 c > 1. Thus, tan xlx > 1, and, therefore, tan x> x.
11.35 If f'(x) = 0 throughout an interval [a, b], prove that /(*) is constant on that interval.
Let «<*<fc. The mean value theorem applies to/(*) on the interval [«,*]. Hence, there exists a c
Since f'(c) = 0, /(*)=/(«). Hence,/(*) has the value/(a)between a and * such that
throughout the interval.
11.36 If f'(x) = g'(x) for all x in an interval [a, b], show that there is a constant K such that f(x) = g(x) + K for
all x in [a, b].
Let h(x)=f(x)-g(x). Then h'(x) = 0 for all x in [a, £>]. By Problem 11.35, there is a constant K such
that h(x) = K for all x in [a, b]. Hence, /(x) = g(x) + K for all x in [a, 6].
11.37 Prove that x3 + px + q = 0 has exactly one real root if p>0.
Let f(x) = x3 + px + q. Then /'(*) = 3*2 + p > 0. Hence, f(x) is an increasing function. So f(x) as-
sumes the value 0 at most once. Now, lim f(x) = +°° and lim f(x) = —». Hence, there are numbers «
and i> where /(w) > 0 and f(v) < 0. By the intermediate value theorem, f(x) assumes the value 0 for some
number between u and v. Thus, f(x) has exactly one real root.
11.38 Prove the following generalized mean value theorem: If f(x) and g(x) are continuous on [a, b], and if fix) and
g(x) are differentiable on (a, b) with g'(x) ^ 0, then there exists a c in (a, b) such that
g(°) * g(b)- [Otherwise, if g(a) = g(b) = K, then Rolle's theorem applied to g(x) - K would yield a
number between a and b at which g'(x) = 0, contrary to our hypothesis.] Let 
and set
F(X) = f(x) ~ f(b> ~ L[g(x) ~ g(b)\. It is easy to see that Rolle's theorem applies to F(x). Therefore, there is a
number c between a and b for which F'(c) = 0. Then, /'(c) — Lg'(c) = 0, and

Let f(x) = 3 tan x + x3. Then /'(*) = 3 sec" x + 3x~ > 0, and, therefore, f(x) is an increasing function.
Thus, f(x) assumes the value 2 at most once. But, /(0) = 0 and /(Tr/4) = 3 + (ir/4)3 >2. So, by the
intermediate value theorem, f(c) = 2 for some c between 0 and rr/4. Hence, f(x) = 2 for exactly one x in
[0, 7T/4].
11.43 Give an example of a function that is continuous on [ —1. 1] and for which the conclusion of the mean value

This is essentially an application of the mean value theorem to f(x) = x~ + x + 3 on the interval [1, 21.
The slope of the line connecting (1,5) and (2,9) is For that line to be parallel
to the tangent line at a point (c, /(c)), the slope of the tangent line, f'(c), must be equal to 4. But, /'(•*) =

By (2), f(x) is never zero. Furthermore, the continuous (because it is differentiable) function/(x) can never be

(n - l)jt"-y + [y2"~V" + (« - 1)2"~V)2] -0. Use (**) to replace y2"~2(y')2 by x2'-2: (n - l)x"-2y" +
[y2"-ly" + (n - I)x2"~2] = 0. Hence,"~ly" = - (n - I)(x2"~2 + *"~2y") = ~(« - l)x"~2(x" + y") =

- (n - l)x"~2a". Thus, y" = -(n - I)a"x"~2/y2"~\ (Check this formula in the special case of Problem
12.11).
12.22 Find y" on the curve x1'2 + y1'2 = a"2.
I Use the formula obtained in Problem 12.21 in the special case n=k: y" = -(- kal>2x~*'2)/y° = ±all2/x3'2.
12.23 Find the 10th and llth derivatives of the function f(x) = ^10 - Ux7 + 3>x' + 2x* -x + 2.
I By the 10th differentiation, the offspring of all the terms except *10 have been reduced to 0. The successive
offspring of x10 are lOx9, 9 • 10x8, 8 • 9 • 10x7, 1-2-3 10. Thus, the 10th derivative is 10!. The llth
derivative is 0.
2.24 For the curve y3 = x2, calculate y' (a) by implicit differentiation and (b) by first solving for y and then
differentiating. Show that the two results agree.
I (a) 3y2y'=2x. Hence, y' =2x/3y2. (b)y = x2'\ So, y' = lx~"\ Observe that, since y2 = x"\
the two answers are the same.
HIGHER-ORDER DERIVATIVES AND IMPLICIT DIFFERENTIATION 77
Use implicit differentiation. (*) 2x + 2(xy' + y) + 6yy' = 0. When y = l, the original equation yields
x2 + 2x + 3 = 2, x2 + 2x + I = 0, (x+l)2 = 0, * + l=0, * = -!. Substitute -1 for x and 1 for y in (*),
which results in —2 + 2(—y' + l) + 6y'=0; so, y'=0 when y = l. To find y", first simplify (*) to
x + xy' + y + 3yy' = 0, and then differentiate implicitly to get 1 + (xy" + y') + y' + 3(yy" + y'y') = 0. In this
equation, substitute —1 for ;c, 1 for y, and 0 for y', which results in 1 - y" + 3y" = 0, y" = -1.
12.16 Find the slope of the tangent line to the graph of y = x + cos xy at (0,1).
Differentiate implicitly to get y' = 1 - [sin xy • (xy' + y)]. Replace x by 0 and y by 1. y' = 1 -
[sin (0) • 1] = 1 - 0 = 1. Thus, the tangent line has slope 1.
12.17 If cosy = x, find/.
Differentiate implicitly: (-sin y)y' = 1. Hence, y' = —l/(siny) =
12.18 Find an equation of the tangent line to the curve 1 + 16* y = tan (x - 2y) at the point (Tr/4, 0).
Differentiating implicitly, I6(x2y' + 2xy) = [sec2(.v - 2y)](l -2y'). Substituting w/4 for x and 0 for y,
16(ir2/16)(y') = [sec2(ir/4)](l-2/). Since cos (77/4) = V3/2, sec2 (77/4) = 2. Thus, Try' = 2(1 - 2y').
Hence, y' =21(17* + 4), which is the slope of the tangent line. A point-slope equation of the tangent line is
y = [2/(7r2 + 4)](x-7r/4).
12.19 Evaluate y" on the ellipse b2x2 + ary2 = a2b2.
Use implicit differentiation to get 2b2x + 2a2yy' = 0, y' = -(b2/a2)(x/y). Now differentiate by the
quotient rule.

12.25 Find a formula for the nth derivative of y = 1 lx(\ - x).
I Observe that y = l/x+ 1/(1-*). Now, the nth derivative of l/x is easily seen to be (-!)"(
and that of !/(*-!) to be («!)(!- x)-(" + l\ Hence, /"' = (n!)[(-l)"/*" + 1 + 1/(1 - Jt)" + I)].
I /'(*)= 2* if x>0 and f'(x)=-2x if x<0. Direct computation by the A-definition, shows that
/'(0) = 0. Hence, f'(x) = 2\x\ for all x. Since \x\ is not differentiable at *=0, /"(O) cannot exist.
12.27 Consider the circles C,: (x - a)2 + y2 = 8 and C2: (x + a)2 + y2=8. Determine the value of |a| so that C,
and C, intersect at right angles.
I Solving the equations for C, and C 2 simultaneously, we find (x — a)2 = (x + a)2, and, therefore, x = 0.
Hence, y = ±V8- a2. OnC1; 2(xl - a) + 2yly'l = 0, so at the intersection points, yly'l = a. (Here, the
subscript indicates values on C,.) On C2, 2(x2 + a) + 1y^y\ = 0, so at the intersection points, y2y'2 = —a.
Hence, multiplying these equations at the intersection points, y\y\y-iy'i = ~<*L- At these points, y\—y-> = y\
hence, y2y\y'2 = ~o2. Since C, and C2 are supposed to be perpendicular at the intersection points, their tangent
lines are perpendicular, and, therefore, the product y[y'2 of the slopes of their tangent lines must be -1. Hence,
-y2=-a2, y2 = a2. But y2 = 8 — a2 at the intersection point. So, a2 = 8 — a2, a2 =4, |a|=2.
12.28 Show that the curves C, : 9y - 6x + y* + x}y = 0 and C,: Wy + I5x + x2 - xy3 = 0 intersect at right angles
at the origin.
I On C,, 9y' -6 + 4y3y' + x3y' + 3x2y = 0. At the origin (0,0), 9/-6 = 0, or /=§. On C,,
10/ + 15 + 2x-y3 -3xy2y' = 0. At the origin, 10>>' + 15 = 0, or / = -§. Since the values of y' on C,
and C2 at the origin are negative reciprocals of each other, the tangent lines of C\ and C2 are perpendicular at the
origin.

12.42 Find the equations of the tangent lines to the ellipse 9x2 + 16y2 = 52 that are parallel to the line 9x-8y = l.
By implicit differentiation, I8x + J>2yy' = 0, y' = -(9;t/16>'). The slope of 9x — 8.y = 1 is \. Hence,
for the tangent line to be parallel to 9x-8y=\, we must have -(9x/l6y) = |, -x = 2y. Substituting in
the equation of the ellipse, we obtain 9(4y2) + I6y2 = 52, 52y~ = 52, y2 = 1, y = ±l. Since x = -2y,
the points of tangency are (—2,1) and (2, —1). Hence, the required equations are y - 1 = g(x + 2) and

By implicit differentiation, (*) 2x - (xy1 + y) + 2yy' = 0. Substitution of (1,2) for (x, y) yields^ 2-
(y1 + 2) + 4y' = 0, / = 0. Implicit differentiation of (*) yields 2 - (xy" + y' + y') + 2yy" + 2(/)2 = 0,
Substitution of (1,2) for (x, y), taking into account that y' = 0 at (1, 2), yields 2 +(4-!)>>" = 0, /'=-§.
This is the rate of change of the slope y' of the tangent line.
In Problems 12.38 to 12.41, use implicit differentiation to find y'.
12.38 tan xy = y.
(sec2 xy) • (xy' + y) = y'. Note that sec2 xy — 1 + tan2 xy = 1 + y'. Hence, (1 + y2)(xy' + y) = y',

12.40 tan2(y+ l) = 3sin.*:.
tan2 (y + l) + l = 3sinx + l, the answer can also be written as y' =

12.41 y = tan2C*r + y).
Note that sec2 (x + y) = tan2 (x + y) + 1 = y + 1. y' = 2 tan (x + y) sec2 (x + y)(l + y') = 2 tan (x + y) x

12.43 Show that the ellipse 4x2 + 9y2 = 45 and the hyperbola x2 — 4y2 = 5 are orthogonal.
I To find the intersection points, multiply the equation of the hyperbola by 4 and subtract the result from the
equation of the ellipse, obtaining 25y2 = 25, y2 = l, y = ±l, x = ±3. Differentiate both sides of the
equation of the ellipse: 8* + I8yy' = 0, y' — — (4x/9y), which is the slope of the tangent line. Differentiate
both sides of the equation of the hyperbola: 2x — 8yy' = 0, y' = x/4y, which is the slope of the tangent line.
Hence, the product of the slopes of the tangent lines is -(4x/9y)- (x/4y) — — (x2/9y2). Since x2 = 9 and
y2 = 1 at the intersection points, the product of the slopes is —1, and, therefore, the tangent lines are
perpendicular.
12.44 Find the slope of the tangent line to the curve x2 + 2xy — 3y2 = 9 at the point (3,2).
I 2x + 2(xy'+ y)-6yy'=0. Replace x by 3 and y by 2, obtaining 6 + 2(3y' + 2) - I2y' =0, 10-6y'=0,
y' = 3 . Thus, the slope is § .
12.45 Show that the parabolas y2 = 4x + 4 and y2 = 4 — 4x intersect at right angles.
I To find the intersection points, set 4x + 4 = 4-4x. Then x = 0, y2=4, y = ±2. For the first
parabola, 2yy'=4, y' = 2/y. For the second parabola, 2yy' = -4, y'=—2/y. Hence, the product of
the slopes of the tangent lines is (2/y)(-2/y) = -4/y2. At the points of intersection, y2 = 4. Hence,,the
product of the slopes is —1, and, therefore, the tangent lines are perpendicular.
12.46 Show that the circles x2 + y2 - I2x - 6y + 25 = 0 and x2 + y' + 2x + y - 10 = 0 are tangent to each other
at the point (2,1).
I For the first circle, 2x + 2yy' - 12 -6y' = 0, and, therefore, at (2,1), 4 + 2y' - 12 - 6y' =0, y'=-2.
For the second circle, 2x + 2yy' + 2 + y' = 0, and, therefore, at (2,1), 4 + 2/ + 2 + y' = 0, >•' = -2.
Since the tangent lines to the two circles at the point (2,1) have the same slope, they are identical, and, therefore,
the circles are tangent at that point.
12.47 If the curve sin y = x* - x5 passes through the point (1,0), find y' and y" at the point (1, 0).

12.48 If x + y = xy, show that y" = 2y*lx\
I 1 + y' = xy' + y, y'(l — x) = y — 1. Note that, from the original equation, y — l = y/x and .v — 1 =

y"(-x/y) = 2(-y2/x2), y" = 2y3/x*.

13.1 State the second-derivative test for relative extrema.
I If f'(c) = 0 and /"(e) <0, then f(x) has a relative maximum at c. [See Fig. 13-l(a).] If /'(c) = 0
and /"(c)>0, then f(x) has a relative minimum at c. [See Fig. 13-l(b).] If f'(c) = Q and /"(c) = 0,
we cannot draw any conclusions at all.

13.2 State the first-derivative test for relative extrema.
I Assume f'(c) = 0. If/' is negative to the left of c and positive to the right of c—thecase{-,+}—then/has
a relative minimum at c. [See Fig. 13-2(o).] If/' is positive to the left of c and negative to the right of c—the
case{ + , -}—then/has a relative maximum at c. [See Fig. 13-2(6).] If/' has the same sign to the left and to
the right of c—{ + , +} or { —, —}—then/has an inflection point at c. [See Fig. 13-2(c).]
13.3 Find the critical numbers of f(x) = 5 — 2x + x2, and determine whether they yield relative maxima, relative
minima, or inflection points.
I Recall that a critical number is a number c such that /(c) is defined and either /'(c) = 0 or /'(c) does not
exist. Now, f'(x) = -2 + 2x. So, we set -2 + 2x = Q. Hence, the only critical number is x = \. But
/"(AT) = 2. In particular, /"(I) = 2>0. Hence, by the second-derivative test, f(x) has a relative minimum at
*=1.

Hence, /"(0) = —2<0, and, therefore, by the second-derivative test, f(x) has a relative maximum at
0. Similarly, f"(2) = 2 > 0, and, therefore, /(*) has a relative minimum at 2.
13.5 Find the critical numbers of f(x) = x3 - 5x2 - 8x + 3, and determine whether they yield relative maxima,
relative minima, or inflection points.
f /'(*) = 3*2 - 10* - 8 = (3x + 2)(x -4). Hence, the critical numbers are x=4 and x=—\. Now,
f"(x) - 6.v - 10. So, /"(4) = 14 > 0, and, by the second-derivative test, there is a relative minimum at x =
4. Similarly, /"(— f) = -14, and, therefore, there is a relative maximum at x = - §.
13.6 Find the critical numbers of /(*) = *(* - I)3, and determine whether they yield relative maxima, relative
minima, or inflection points.
f'(x) = x-3(x-l)2 + (x-lY = (x- l)2(3x + x-l) = (x- 1) (4x - 1). So, the critical numbers are x = I
and x=\. Now, f"(x) = (x - I)2 • 4 + 2(x - l)(4x - 1) = 2(x - l)[2(jt - 1) + 4* - 1] = 2(jt - 1)(6* - 3)
= 6(jf - l)(2;c - 1). Thus, /"(J) = 6(-i)(-j) = ! >0, and, therefore, by the second-derivative test, there is a
relative minimum at *=j. On the other hand /"(I) = 6-0-1 =0, and, therefore, the second-derivative
test is inapplicable. Let us use the first-derivative test. f'(x) - (x - 1)2(4* - 1). For jr^l, (A:-I)2 is
positive. Since 4x — 1 has the value 3 when x = l, 4x —1>0 just to the left and to the right of 1.
Hence,/'(*) is positive both on the left and on the right of x = 1, and this means that we have the case { + , +}.
By the first-derivative test, there is an inflection point at x = 1.
13.7 Find the critical numbers of f(x) = sinx — x, and determine whether they yield relative maxima, relative
minima, or inflection points.
I f'(x) = cos x — 1. The critical numbers are the solutions of cos* = 1, and these are the numbers x =
2irn for any integer n. Now, f"(x) = —sinx. So, f"(2irn) = -sin (Iirn) = -0 = 0, and, therefore, the
second-derivative test is inapplicable. Let us use the first-derivative test. Immediately to the left and right
of x = 2irn, cosjc<l, and, therefore, /'(*) = cos x - 1 < 0. Hence, the case {-,—} holds, and there is
an inflection point at x — 7.-nn.
13.8 Find the critical numbers of f(x) = (x - I)2'3 and determine whether they yield relative maxima, relative
minima, or inflection points.
I /'(*)= !(x-l)~"3 = §{l/(x-l)"3]. There are no values of x for which /'(*) = 0, but jt = 1 is a
critical number, since/'(l) is not defined. Try the first-derivative test [which is also applicable when/'(c) is not
defined]. To the left of x = \, (x - 1) is negative, and, therefore,/'(.*) is negative. To the right of x = l,
(jt-1) is positive, and, therefore, f(x) is positive. Thus, the case {-,+} holds, and there is a relative
minimum at x = 1.
13.9 Describe a procedure for finding the absolute maximum and absolute minimum values of a continuous function
f(x) on a closed interval [a, b\.
I Find all the critical numbers of f(x) in [a, b]. List all these critical numbers, c,, c2,.. ., and add the
endpoints a and b to the list. Calculate /(AC) for each x in the list. The largest value thus obtained is the
maximum value of f(x) on [a, b], and the minimal value thus obtained is the minimal value of f(x) on [a, b].
82 CHAPTER 13
13.4 Find the critical numbers of /(*) = x l(x - 1) and determine whether they yield relative maxima, relative
minima, or inflection points.
Hence, the critical numbers are x = 0 and x — 2. [x = 1 is not a critical number because /(I) is not
defined.] Now let us compute f"(x).

MAXIMA AND MINIMA
13.10 Find the absolute maximum and minimum of the function f(x) = 4x2 - 7x + 3 on the interval [-2,3].
/'(*) = 8* - 7. Solving Sx -1 = 0, we find the critical number x=l, which lies in the interval. So
we list 1 and the endpoints -2 and 3 in a table, and calculate the corresponding values/(x). The absolute
maximum 33 is assumed at x = —2. The absolute minimum - A is assumed at x = 1.
13.11 Find the absolute maximum and minimum of f(x) = 4x3 - Sx2 + 1 on the closed interval [-1,1].
I /'(*) = 12x2 - I6x = 4x(3x -4). So, the critical numbers are x = 0 and x=%. But *=f does not
lie in the interval. Hence, we list only 0 and the endpoints -1 and 1, and calculate the corresponding values of
f(x). So, the absolute maximum 1 is achieved at x = 0, and the absolute minimum -11 is achieved at
*=-!.
13.13 Find the absolute maximum and minimum of f(x) = x3/(x + 2) on the interval f-1,1].
Thus, the critical numbers are x = 0 and x = -3. However, x = -3 is not in the given interval. So, we
list 0 and the endpoints -1 and 1. The absolute maximum 5 is assumed at x = l, and the absolute minimum
— 1 is assumed at x = — 1 .
13.14 For what value of k will f(x) = x - kx \ have a relative maximum at x = -2?
f'(x) = 1 + kx~2 = 1 + klx2. We want-2 to be a critical number, that is, l + fc/4 = 0. Hence, k =-4.
Thus, f'(x) = 1 -4/x2, and f"(x) = 8/x\ Since /"(-2) = -l, there is a relative maximum at * =-2.
13.15 Find the absolute extrema of /(*) = sin x + x on[0,2-7r].
/'(*) = cos x + 1- For a critical number, cos*+1=0, or cos* = -l. The only solution of this equa-
tion in [0,2ir] is x = TT. We list TT and the two endpoints 0 and 2w, and compute the values of/(jc). Hence, the
absolute maximum 2IT is achieved at x = 2w, and the absolute minimum 0 at x = 0.

13.12 Find the absolute maximum and minimum of f(x) = x4 - 2x3 - x2 - 4x + 3 on the interval [0, 4].
f'(x) = 4x3 - 6x2 - 2x - 4 = 2(2x3 -3x2-x~2). We first search for roots of 2x3 - 3x2 ~ x - 2 by trying
integral factors of the constant term 2. It turns out that x = 2 is a root. Dividing 2x3 - 3x2 - x -2 by
x — 2, we obtain the quotient 2x2 + x + l. By the quadratic formula, the roots of the latter are x =
(—l±V^7)/4, which are not real. Thus, the only critical number is x = 2. So, listing 2 and the endpointsO
and 4, we calculate the corresponding values off(x). Thus, the absolute maximum 99 is attained at x = 4, and
the absolute minimum -9 at x = 2.

13.16 Find the absolute extrema of f(x) = sin x — cos x on [0, TT].
/'(*) = cos x + sin x. Setting this equal to 0, we have sin* =-cos*, or tan AC = -1. The only solution
for this equation in [0, TT] is 3?r/4. Thus, the only critical number is 377/4. We list this and the endpoints 0 and
77, and calculate the corresponding values of f(x). Then, the absolute maximum V2 is attained at x = 377/4,
and the absolute minimum -1 is attained at x = 0.
13.17 (a) Find the absolute extrema of /(*) = x - sin .v on [0, 77/2]. (ft) Show that sin;t<;t for all positive or.
(a) /'(*) = 1 - cos AT. Setting l-cos;c = 0, COSJT = !, and the only solution in [0,77/2] is x =
0. Thus, the only critical number is 0, which is one of the endpoints. Drawing up the usual table, we find that
the absolute maximum 77/2 - 1 is achieved at .v = 77/2 and the absolute minimum 0 is achieved at x =
0. (b) By part (a), since the absolute minimum of x - sin x on [0. 77/2] is 0, which is achieved only at 0, then,
for positive A: in that interval, x — sinx>0, or A'> sin AT. For .v > 77/2, sin x s 1 < 77/2 < x.
This is never 0, and, therefore, there are no critical num-

/'(A-) = 3jt2 - 3p - 3(x2 — p). Set f'(x) = 0. Then x~ = p. If p<0. there are no critical numbers
and, therefore, no relative extrema. If ps?Q, the critical numbers are ±\fp. Now, f"(x) = 6x. If
p>0, /"(V7>) = 6\/P > 0, and, therefore, there is a relative minimum at x = \/p; while, f"(-Vp) =
—6Vp<0, and, therefore, there is a relative maximum at x=—\fp. If p = 0, f'(x) = 3x2, and, at the
critical number x = 0, we have the case { + , +} of the first-derivative test; thus, if p = 0, there is only an
inflection point at x = 0 and no extrema.

f'(x) = 3O - 2)4O + I)2 + 40 - 2)30 + I)3 = (x - 2)\x + l)2[3(x - 2) + 4(x + 1)] = (x - 2)3(jc + l)2(7x - 2).
Hence, the critical numbers are x = 2, x = —l, x=j. We shall use the first-derivative test. At x = 2,
(x + l)2(7Ar — 2) is positive, and, therefore, (x + l)~(7x - 2) is positive immediately to the left and right of
x = 2. For x<2, x-2<0, (;t-2)3<0, and, therefore, /'(.v)<0. For x>2, (x-2)3>0, and,
therefore, /'(x)>0. Thus, we have the case {-, +}; therefore, there is a relative minimum at x = 2. For
* = -!, x-2<0, (x-2)3<0, 7*-2<0, and. therefore, (.v - 2)3(7.v - 2) >0. Thus, immediately to
the left and right of * = -!, (jc - 2)3(7.v - 2) >0. (A- + l)2>0 on both sides of *=-!. Hence,
/'(*)>0 on both sides of AC=—1. Thus, we have the case { + .+}. and there is an inflection point at
x=-l. For Jt=f, (jc -2)3(* + I)2 <0. Hence, immediately to the left and right of x = % (je-2)3(* +

7x-2>0, and, therefore, f'(x)<0 immediately to the right of 5. Thus, we have the case { + ,-}, and,
therefore, there is a relative maximum at x = ^.

13.22 Find the absolute maximum and minimum of f(x) = -4*+ 5 on [-2,3].
Since f(x) is a decreasing linear function, the absolute maximum is attained at the left endpoint and the

Setting /'(*)=0, we have 2x2 = l, x2=\, * = ±V2/2. So, the only critical number in [0, +00) is
x = V2/2. At that point, the first derivative test involves the case { + , -}, and, therefore, there is a relative
maximum at x = V2~/2, where y = 2V3/9. Since this is the only critical number in the given interval, the
relative maximum is actually an absolute maximum.
13.30 Find the absolute maximum and minimum of f(x) = cos2 x + sin x on [0, ir].
/'(*) = 2cos*(-sinx) + cosjc. Setting /'(*) = °> we have cos jc(l -2sinx) = 0, cos* = 0 or 1-
2sinx =0. In the given interval, cosx = 0 at x = trl2. In the given interval, l-2sinx = 0 (that is,
sinx=i) only when A: = 77/6 or x = 5ir/6. So, we must tabulate the values of f(x) at these critical
numbers and at the endpoints. We see that the absolute maximum is f, attained at x = 77/6 and x = 577/6.
The absolute minimum is 1, attained at x=0, x= ir!2, and x = 77.
13.31 Find the absolute maximum and minimum of f(x) = 2 sin x + sin 2x on [0,2IT].
/'(*) = 2 cos x + 2 cos 2x. Setting /'(AC) = 0, we obtain cos x + cos 2x = 0. Since cos 2x = 2 cos2 x - 1,
we have 2cos2 x + cosx — 1 = 0, (2cosx — 1) (cos* + 1) = 0, cosx = — 1 or cos x —\. In the given
interval, the solution of cosx= — 1 is x = 77, and the solutions of cos;t=j are x = 7r/3 and x =
STT/S. We tabulate the values of f(x) for these critical numbers and the endpoints. So, the absolute maximum is
3V3/2, attained at x - 77/3, and the absolute minimum is -3V3/2, attained at x = 577/3.
13.32 Find the absolute maximum and minimum of f(x) = x/2 — sin x on [0,2-n],

and x = 577/3. We tabulate the values of f(x) for these numbers and the endpoints. Note that 77/6<V3/2
(since 7r<3V3). Hence, 77/6- V3/2<0< TT<5-77/6 + V3/2. So, the absolute maximum is 5ir/6 +

13.33 Find the absolute maximum and minimum of f(x) = 3 sin x — 4 cos x on [0,2-rr].
f'(x) = 3 cos x + 4 sin x. Setting f'(x) = 0, we have 3 cos x = -4 sin x, tan *=-0.75. There are two
critical numbers: x0, between ir/2 and IT, and xl, between 37T/2 and 2ir. We calculate the values of f(x) for
these numbers by using the 3-4-5 right triangle and noting that, sin x0 = f and cos x0 = - 5, and that
8^*, = -! and COSA:^^. So, the absolute maximum is 5, attained at x = x0, and the absolute

13.28 Find the absolute maximum and minimum (if they exist) of /(*) = (x2 + 4)/(x -2) on the interval [0, 2).
By the quadratic formula, applied to x2 — 4* — 4 = 0, we
find the critical numbers 2±2V2, neither of which is in the given interval. Since /'(0) = -1, /'(*)
remains negative in the entire interval, and, therefore, f(x) is a decreasing function. Thus, its maximum is
attained at the left endpoint 0, and this maximum value is -2. Since/(x) approaches -<» as x approaches 2 from
the left, there is no absolute minimum
13.29 Find the absolute maximum and minimum (if they exist) of f(x) = x/(x2 + I)3'2 on [0, +»).

The top of a 25-foot ladder, leaning against a vertical wall is slipping down the wall at the rate of 1 foot per second.
How fast is the bottom of the ladder slipping along the ground when the bottom of the ladder is 7 feet away from
the base of the wall?
Fig. 14-1
I Let y be the distance of the top of the ladder from the ground, and let x be the distance of the bottom of the
ladder from the base of the wall (Fig. 14-1). By the Pythagorean theorem, x2 + y2 = (25)2. Differentiating
with respect to time t, 2x • D,x + 2y • D,y = 0; so, x • D,x + y • Dty = 0. The given information tells us that
D,y = -1 foot per second. (Since the ladder is sliding down the wall, y is decreasing, and, therefore, its
derivative is negative.) When x = 7, substitution in x2 + y2 = (25)2 yields y2 = 576, y = 24. Substitu-

A cylindrical tank of radius 10 feet is being filled with wheat at the rate of 314 cubic feet per minute. How fast is

I Let V be the volume of wheat at time t, and let h be the depth of the wheat in the tank. Then V= ir(W)2h.
So, D,V = 1007T • D,h. But we are given that DtV= 314 cubic feet per minute. Hence, 314 = lOO-tr • D,h,
D,h = 314/(1007r). If we approximate TT by 3.14, then D,h = l. Thus, the depth of the wheat is increasing at
the rate of 1 cubic foot per minute.
A 5-foot girl is walking toward a 20-foot lamppost at the rate of 6 feet per second. How fast is the tip of her

Fig. 14-2
I Let x be the distance of the girl from the base of the post, and let y be the distance of the tip of her shadow
from the base of the post (Fig. 14-2). AABC is similar to ADEC. Hence, ABIDE = y/(y - x), f =
yl(y-x), 4 = y/(y-x), 4y-4x = y, 3y = 4x. Hence, 3 • D,y = 4 • D,x. But, we are told that D,x=-6
feet per second. (Since she is walking toward the base, x is decreasing, and D,x is negative.) So 3 • D,y =
4 • (-6), Dty = -8. Thus the tip of the shadow is moving at the rate of 8 feet per second toward the base of the
post.
Under the same conditions as in Problem 14.3, how fast is the length of the girl's shadow changing?

from the launching site, when the rocket is still rising and is 2400 feet above the ground?
Fig. 14-3
I Let M be the distance from the rocket to the observer, as shown in Fig. 14-3. By the Pythagorean theorem,
w2 = s2 + (1800)2. Hence, 2u • D,u = 2s • D,s, u-D,u = s-D,s. When s = 2400, u2 = (100)2 • (900), u =
100-30 = 3000. Since s = 400/-16/2, when s = 2400, 2400 = 400f - I6t2, t2 - 251 + 150 = 0,
(t - W)(t - 15) = 0. So, on the way up, the rocket is at 2400 feet when / = 10. But, D,s = 400 - 32;. So,
when t=W, D,s = 400 - 32 • 10 = 80. Substituting in u-D,u = s-Dts, we obtain 3000 • D,u = 2400 • 80,
D,u = 64. So the distance from the rocket to the observer is increasing at the rate of 64 feet per second when

dropping when the level stands 5 centimeters above the vertex of the cone? (Remember that the volume of a
cone is \irr2h.)
Fig. 14-4
I The fluid in the funnel forms a cone with radius r, height h, and volume V. By similar triangles, r/4 = /i/20,
r=h/5. So, V=^irr2h=$Tr(h/5)2h= Jsirh3. Hence, D,V= ^trh2 • D,h. We are given that D,V=

-300 = irh2 • D,h. When h = 5, -300= -rr -25 • D,h, Dlh = ~l2/Tr, or approximately -3.82 centimeters

I The area 800 = fw. Differentiating, 0= (• D,w + w D,f. We are given that D/ = 4. So, 0 =
f-D,w + 4w. When D,w=-0.5, 0=-0.5/ + 4w, 4w = 0.5^. But <f = 800/w. So, 4w = 0.5(800/w) =

Substituting in u • D,u = w • D,w + t- D,f, 20V5 • D,u = 20-(-2) + 40-4= 120, D,u = 6V5/5 = 2.69mm/s.

250?r/3. Thus, the total volume of the water is V= V2-Vl= 25077/3 - irr2y/3. By similar triangles,
10/5 = y/r, y = 2r. So, V= 25077/3 - irr2(2r}/3 = 2507T/3 - 2irr3/3. Hence, D,V= -2-nr2 • D,r. We
aregiventhat D,V=3.14. So, 3.14= -2-rrr2 • D,r. Thus, D,r = -3.14/2-trr2. When the water stands

f Let x be the horizontal distance from the bow ring to the dock, and let u be the length of the rope between the
dock and the boat. Then, u2 = x2 + (8)2. So 2u • D,u = 2x • D,x, u • D,u = x • D,x. We are told that
D,u = -3. So -3u = x-D,x. When u = 10, x2 = 36, x = 6. Hence, -3 • 10 = 6 • D,x, D,x = -5. So
the boat is approaching the dock at the rate of 5 ft/s.
A girl is flying a kite, which is at a height of 120 feet. The wind is carrying the kite horizontally away from the girl
at a speed of 10 feet per second. How fast must the kite string be let out when the string is 150 feet long?
I Let x be the horizontal distance of the kite from the point directly over the girl's head at 120 feet. Let u be the
length of the kite string from the girl to the kite. Then u2 = x1 + (120)2. So, 2u • D,u = 2x • Drx, u-D,u =
x-D,x. We are told that D,* = 10. Hence, u • D,u = 10*. When w = 150, x2 = 8100, x=90. So,
150 • Z>,M = 900, D,M=6ft/s.
A rectangular trough is 8 feet long, 2 feet across the top, and 4 feet deep. If water flows in at a rate of 2 ft3/min,
how fast is the surface rising when the water is 1 ft deep?
I Let A: be the depth of the water. Then the water is a rectangular slab of dimensions AT, 2, and 8. Hence, the
volume V= 16*. So D,V= 16- D,x. We are told that DtV=2. So, 2=16-D,*. Hence, D,x =
5 ft/min.
A ladder 20 feet long leans against a house. Find the rate at which the top of the ladder is moving downward if
the foot of the ladder is 12 feet away from the house and sliding along the ground away from the house at the rate
of 2 feet per second?
I Let x be the distance of the foot of the ladder from the base of the house, and let y be the distance of the top
of the ladder from the ground. Then x2 + y2 = (20)2. So, 2x • Dtx + 2y • Dty = 0, x • D,x + y • D,y = 0.
We are told that x = 12 and D,x = 2. When * = 12, y2 = 256, y = 16. Substituting in x-D,x +
y-D,y = Q, 12- 2 + 16- D,y = 0, Dty = -\. So the ladder is sliding down the wall at the rate of 1.5 ft/s.
14.25 A train, starting at 11 a.m., travels east at 45 miles per hour, while another starting at noon from the same point

I Let the time t be measured in hours, starting at 11 a.m. Let x be the distance that the first train is east of the
starting point, and let y be the distance that the second train is south of the starting point. Let u be the distance
between the trains. Then u2 = x2 + y2, 2u • D,u = 2x • D,x + 2y • D,y, u • D,u = x • D,x + y • D,y. We are
told that D,x = 45 and D,y = 60.

In Problem 14.23, how fast is the angle a between the ladder and the ground changing at the given moment?
tan a = y/x. So, by the chain rule, sec2 a • Dta
Also, tan a =)>/*= if = f. So, sec a = 1 + tan o = 1 + f = ¥• Thus, f-D,a = -^, D,a = -|.
Hence, the angle is decreasing at the rate of § radian per second.

therefore, y = 180. Then, u2 = (ISO)2 + (ISO)2, u = 180V2. Thus, 180V5 • D,M = 45 • 180 + 60 • 180,

14.26 A light is at the top of a pole 80 feet high. A ball is dropped from the same height (80 ft) from a point 20 feet
from the light. Assuming that the ball falls according to the law s = 16f2, how fast is the shadow of the ball
moving along the ground one second later?
I See Fig. 14-9. Let x be the distance of the shadow of the ball from the base of the lightpole. Let y be the
height of the ball above the ground. By similar triangles, y/80 = (x-20)/x. But, y-8Q-l6t2. So,
l-^2 = l-(20/jt). Differentiating, -fr= (20/Jt2)- D,x. When f=l, 1 - \(l)2 = I -20/jc, x = 100.
Substituting in - f / = (20/*2) • D,x, D,x = -200. Hence, the shadow is moving at 200 ft/s.

14.27 Ship A is 15 miles east of point O and moving west at 20 miles per hour. Ship B is 60 miles south of O and moving
north at 15 miles per hour. Are they approaching or separating after 1 hour, and at what rate?
I Let the point O be the origin of a coordinate system, with A moving on the Jt-axis and B moving on the y-axis
(Fig. 14-10). Since A begins at x = 15 and is moving to the left at 20 mi/h, its position is x = 15 - 20/.
Likewise, the position of B is y = -60 + I5t. Let u be the distance between A and B. Then u2 = x2 + y2,
2u • D,u = 2x • D,x + 2y • D,y, u-D,u = x • D,x + y • D,y. Since D,x = -20 and D,y = 15, u-D,u =
-20x + 15y. When f = l, * = 15-20=-5, y = -60+ 15 = -45, u2 = (-5)2 + (-45)2 = (25)(82), « =
5V82. Substituting in «•£>,« = -20* + 15y, 5V82Z>,« =-575, D,u = -115/V82* -13. Since the de-
rivative of u is negative, the distance between the ships is getting smaller, at roughly 13 mi/h.
14.28 Under the same hypotheses as in Problem 14.27, when are the ships nearest each other?
I When the ships are nearest each other, their distance u assumes a relative minimum, and, therefore,
D,u = 0. Substituting in u-D,u = -20x + 15y, 0 = -20* + 15y. But jc = 15 - 20t and y = -60 + 15f.
So, 0 =' -20(15 - 200 + 15(-60 + 150, ' = i hours, or approximately, 1 hour and 55 minutes.

8 feet in diameter at the top. At the time the water is 12 feet deep, the water level is observed to be rising 4
inches per minute. How fast is the water leaking out?
I Let h be the depth of the water, and let r be the radius of the water surface (Fig. 14-11). The water's volume
V=^trr2h. By similar triangles, r/4 = fc/16, r=\h, V= ^Tr(h/4)2h = ±rrh3. So D,V= ^-rrh2 • D,h.
We are told that when h = 12, D,h = j . Hence, at that moment, D,V = Tfeir(l44)( j ) = 3ir. Since the rate
at which the water is pouring in is 10, the rate of leakage is (10 - ITT) ft3/min.

from the lighthouse 5 to A, and the beacon (Fig. 14-14). Then tan a = je/3600, so sec2 a • D,a = 3555 • D,x.
We are told that D,a=4?r. When the beacon hits point A, a=0, seca = l, so 4n=jsooD,x,
D,x = 14,40077- ft/min = 2407T ft/s.
Two sides of a triangle are 15 and 20 feet long, respectively. How fast is the third side increasing when the angle

I Let x be the third side. By the law of cosines, x2 = (15)2 + (20)2 -2(15)(20)-cos a. Hence, 2x • D,x =
600sino-D,a. x- D,x = 300sin a • D,a. We are told that D,a =2- (Tr/180) = 7r/90rad/s. When o =

the instant when the width is 2 cm?
I A = fw, and e = w2. So, A = w3. Hence, D,A = 3w2 • D,w. We are told that D,^=48. Hence,
48 = 3w2-D,w, I6=w2-D,w. When w = 2, 16 = 4-D,»v, D,w = 4. Since e = w2, D,€ = 2wD,w.

A spherical snowball is melting (symmetrically) at the rate of 4ir cubic centimeters per hour. How fast is the

I The volume V= fur3. So, D,V=4irr2 • D,r. We are told that D,V=-4ir. Hence, -4-n- =
4irr~ • D,r. Thus, —\ = r2-Dlr. When the diameter is 20 centimeters, the radius r = 10. Hence, -1 =
100 • D,r, D,r=-0.0l. Since the diameter d = 2r, D,d = 2- D,r = 2- (-0.01) = -0.02. So, the diameter

A trough is 10 feet long and has a cross section in the shape of an equilateral triangle 2 feet on each side (Fig.

1 ft deep?
I The water in the trough will have a cross section that is an equilateral triangle, say of height h and side s.
In an equilateral triangle with side s, s = 2/Z/V3. Hence, the cross-sectional area of the water is
| • (2/J/V3) • h = /z2/V3. Therefore, the volume V of water is 10/iW3. So, D,V= (20/I/V3) • D ,h. We
are told that D,V=20. So, 20 = (20A/V3)- D,h, V3 = h-D,h. When h = 1 ft, D,h = V3 ft/min.
If a mothball evaporates at a rate proportional to its surface area 4irr2, show that its radius decreases at a constant

I Since pV= constant, p • D,V + V- D,p =0. We are told that D,V= -12, so -12p + V- D,p =0.
When V= 1000 and p = 10, Dtp = 0.12 pound per square inch per minute.

I Let h be the depth of the water at time t. The cross-sectional area is 3h + h2 (see Fig. 14-21), and,
therefore, the volume V = 20(3h + h1). So D,V= 20(3 • D,h + 2h • D,h) = 20 • D,h • (3 + 2h). We are told

shadow of the man's head on the wall. By similar triangles, 6/(x + u) — 10/(15 + u) = zlu. From the first
equation, we obtain w=f(9-;t). Hence, x + u = f(15 - x). Since zlu = 6/(x + u), z = 6u/(* + w) =
10(9-x)/(15-je) = 10[l-6/(15-jc)]. Thus, D,z = [10- 6/(15 - x)2} • (~D,x). We are told that D,x = -5.

rate of 2ir cm3/min. How fast is the thickness of ice decreasing when the ice is 2 centimeters thick?
I Let x be the thickness of the ice. Then the volume of the ice V = 300[Tr(10 + xf - lOOir], So D,V =
300ir[2(10 + x)• D,x]. Since D,V= -2ir, we have -277 = 600ir(10 + x)• D,x, D,x = -I/[300(10 + x)].
When x = 2, Dtx = — 3555 cm/min. So the thickness is decreasing at the rate of 5^5 centimeter per minute
(4 millimeters per day).

Curve Sketching (Graphs)
When sketching a graph, show all relative extrema, inflection points, and asymptotes; indicate concavity; and
suggest the behavior at infinity.
In Problems 15.1 to 15.5, determine the intervals where the graphs of the following functions are concave
upward and where they are concave downward. Find all inflection points.
15.1 f(x) = x2 - x + 12.
I
 f'(x) = 2x — l, f"(x) = 2. Since the second derivative is always positive, the graph is always concave
upward and there are no inflection points.
15.2 /(*) = A:3 + I5x2 + 6x + 1.
I f'(x) = 3x2+3Qx + 6, f"(x) = 6x + 30 = 6(x + 5). Thus, f"(x)>0 when jc>-5; hence, the graph is
concave upward for ;t>-5. Since f"(x)<0 for x<-5, the graph is concave downward for x<-5.
Hence, there is an inflection point, where the concavity changes, at (5,531).
15.3 /(AT) = x4 + I8x3 + UOx2 + x + l.
I f'(x) = 4xj+ 54x2+240x + l, f"(x) = \2x2 + W8x + 240= 12(x2 + 9x + 20) = U(x + 4)(x + 5). Thus,
the important points are x = -4 and x = -5. For x > -4, x + 4 and x + 5 are positive, and, there-
fore, so is /"(•*). For -5<A:<-4, x + 4 is negative and x + 5 is positive; he nee, f"(x) is negative. For
x<-5, both x+4 and x + 5 are negative, and, therefore,/"(A:) is positive. Therefore, the graph is
concave upward for x > -4 and for A: < -5. The graph is concave downward for -5 < x < -4. Thus,
the inflection points are (-4,1021) and (-5,1371).
15.4 f(x) = x/(2x-l).
I /(*) = [(*-i)+|]/[2(*-i)]=i{l + [l/(2*-l)]}. Hence, /'(*) = i[-l/(2* - I)2] -2 = -l/(2x - I)2.
Then /"(*) = [l/(2x - I)3] -2 = 2/(2x - I)3. For x>$, 2* - 1 >0, f"(x)>0, and the graph is concave
upward. For x<\, 2x — 1<0, /"(AC)<O, and the graph is concave downward. There is no inflection
point, since f(x) is not defined when x = |.
15.5 f(x) = 5x4 - x".
I f'(x) = 2Qx*-5x\ and /"(*) = 6Qx2 -20x* = 20x\3 - x). So, for 0<*<3 and for *<0, 3-
;c>0, /"(A-)>O, and the graph is concave upward. For jc>3, 3-Jc<0, /"(AT)<O, and the graph is
concave downward. There is an inflection point at (3,162). There is no inflection point at x = 0; the graph
is concave upward for x < 3.
For Problems 15.6 to 15.10, find the critical numbers and determine whether they yield relative maxima, relative
minima, inflection points, or none of these.
15.6 f(x) = 8 - 3x + x2.
I f'(x) = -3 + 2x, f"(x) = 2. Setting -3 + 2A: = 0, we find that x = \ is a critical number. Since
/"(AC) = 2>0, the second-derivative test tells us that there is a relative minimum at x= \.
15.7 f(x) = A-4 - ISA:2 + 9.
I /'W = 4Ar3-36A: = 4A:(A;2-9) = 4A:(A:-3)(A: + 3). f(x) = 12;t2 - 36 = 12(A:2 - 3). The critical numbers
are 0, 3, -3. /"(O) =-36<0; hence, x = 0 yields a relative maximum. /"(3) = 72>0; hence, x = 3
yields a relative minimum. /"(-3) = 72>0; hence x = -3 yields a relative minimum. There are inflection
points at x = ±V5, y = -36.

/"(-§)=-14 <0; hence, *=-§ yields a relative maximum. /"(4)=14>0; hence, x = 4 yields a
relative minimum. There is an inflection point at x = f.
15.9
15.10 f(x) = x2/(x2 + l).
I f(x) = 1- l/(jc2 + 1). So, f'(x) = 2x/(x2 + I)2. The only critical number is x = 0. Use the first-deriva-
tive test. To the right of 0, f'(x)>0, and to the left of 0, /'(*)<0. Thus, we have the case {-,+}, and,
therefore, x = 0 yields a relative minimum. Using the quotient rule, f"(x) = 2(1 - 3jt2)/(;t2 + I)3. So,
there are inflection points at x = ± 1 /V3, y = 1.
In Problems 15.11 to 15.19, sketch the graph of the given function.
15.11 f(x) = (x2 - I)3.
| f(x) = 3(x - i)2 . 2x = 6x(x2 - I)2 = 6x(x - l)\x + I)2. There are three critical numbers 0,1, and -1.

At x=Q, f'(x)>0 to the right of 0, and /'(*)< 0 to the left of 0. Hence, we have the case {-,+} of
the first derivative test; thus x = 0 yields a relative minimum at (0, -1). For both x = l and x = —I,
f'(x) has the same sign to the right and to the left of the critical number; therefore, there are inflection points at
(1,0) and (-1,0). When x-»±=°, /(*)-»+».
It is obvious from what we have of the graph in Fig. 15-1 so far that there must be inflection points between
x=— 1 and x = 0, and between x = Q and jc = l. To find them, we compute the second derivative:
/"(*) = 6(x - l)2(x + I)2 + I2x(x - l)2(x + 1) + 12*(x - l)(x + I)2
= 6(x — l)(x + l)[(x — l)(x + 1) + 2x(x - 1) + 2x(x + 1)]
Hence, the inflection points occur when

vertex at (J, — |) and passing through (1,0). Now consider *<1. Then f(x) = — x(x — 1) = — (x2 — x) =

hence, there is a relative maximum at x=-rr/2, y = l, and similarly at x=-ir/2, y = l. Inflection
points occur where f"(x) = 2 cos 2x = 0, 2x = ± ir/2, x = ± ir/4, y = \. The graph is shown in Fig. 15-21.

/"(57r/4)= -(-V2/2- V2/2) = V2>0. Thus, there is a relative minimum at A = 577/4, y = -V2. The
inflection points occur where f"(x) = -(sin x + cos A:) = 0, sinx =-cos*, tanx = —1, A-= 377/4 or x =

the solutions of 3cos3 A = 0, COSA- = O, x = --rr/2 or A = 77/2. /"(—77/2) = 0, so we must use the
first-derivative test. f'(x) is negative to the left of - 77/2 and positive to the right of - 77/2. Hence, we ha ve the

2(cos2 x - sin2 x) - cos x = 2(2 cos2 * - 1) - cos x = 4 cos2 x - cos x - 2. Since f(x) has a period of 27r, we need
only consider, say, [-ir, ir]. Moreover, since f(-x) = f(x), we only have to consider [0, ir], and then reflect
in the _y-axis. The critical numbers are the solutions in [0, TT] of sin x = 0 or 2 cos x - 1 = 0. The equation
sin x = 0 has the solutions 0, TT. The equation 2 cos x — 1=0 is equivalent to cos x = \, having the
solution x = ir/3. /"(0) = 1>0, so there is a relative minimum at x = 0, y = 0. /"(7r) = 3>0, so there
is a relative minimum at x = TT, y = -2. f(ir/3) = - § < 0, so there is a relative maximum at x = ir/3,
y = 1. There are inflection points between 0 and 7r/3 and between ir/3 and TT; they can be approximated by
using the quadratic formula to solve f"(x) = 4 cos2 x - cos x - 2 = 0 for cos x, and then using a cosine table to
approximate x. See Fig. 15-24.

Minimum Problems
16.1 A rectangular field is to be fenced in so that the resulting area is c square units. Find the dimensions of that field
(if any) for which the perimeter is a minimum, and the dimensions (if any) for which the perimeter is a maximum.
I Let f be the length and w the width. Then f w = c. The perimeter p = 2( + 2w = 2( + 2c/f. ( can be
any positive number. D (p = 2-2c/f2, and D2ep=4c/f3. Hence, solving 2-2c/f2 = 0, we see that
f = Vc is a critical number. The second derivative is positive, and, therefore, there is a relative minimum at
t = Vc. Since that is the only critical number and the function 2f + 2c/f is continuous for all positive f,
there is an absolute minimum at f = Vc. (If p achieved a still smaller value at some other point f0, there would
have to be a relative maximum at some point between Vc and f0, yielding another critical number.) When
( = Vc, w = Vc. Thus, for a fixed area, the square is the rectangle with the smallest perimeter. Notice that
the perimeter does not achieve a maximum, since p = 2f + 2c//—» +00 as f—»+00.
16.2 Find the point(s) on the parabola 2x = y2 closest to the point (1,0).
I Refer to Fig. 16-1. Let u be the distance between (1,0) and a point (x, y) on the parabola. Then
u = V(* - I)2 + y2. To minimize u it suffices to minimize u2 = (x - I)2 + y2. Now, u2 = (x - I)2 + 2x.
Since (x, y) is a point on 2x = y2, x can be any nonnegative number. Now, Dx(u2) = 2(x - 1) + 2 = 2x > 0
for *>0. Hence, u2 is an increasing function, and, therefore, its minimum value is attained at x = 0, y = 0.

Find the point(s) on the hyperbola x2-y2 = 2 closest to the point (0,1).
I Refer to Fig. 16-2. Let u be the distance between (0,1) and a point (x, y) on the hyperbola. Then
M = V*2 + (.y ~!)2- To minimize M, it suffices to minimize u2 = x2 + (y - I)2 = 2 + y2 + (y - I)2. Since
*2 = y2 + 2, y can be any real number. Dy(u2) = 2y + 2(y - 1) = 4y -2. Also, D2(M2) = 4. The only
critical number is |, and, since the second derivative is positive, there is a relative minimum at y = \, x=±\.
Since there is only one critical number, this point yields the absolute minimum.
A closed box with a square base is to contain 252 cubic feet. The bottom costs $5 per square foot, the top costs $2
per square foot, and the sides cost $3 per square foot. Find the dimensions that will minimize the cost.
I Let s be the side of the square base and let h be the height. Then s2h = 252. The cost of the bottom
is 5s2, the cost of the top is 2s2, and the cost of each of the four sides is 3sh. Hence, the total cost
C = 5s2 + 2s2 + 4(3sfc) = 7s2 + I2sh = 7s2 + 12s(252/s2) = 7s2 + 3024/s. s can be any positive number. Now,
DsC = 14s- 3024/s2, and D2C= 14 +6048/s3. Solving 14s - 3024/s2 = 0, 14s3 = 3024, s3 = 216, s = 6.
Thus, s = 6 is the only critical number. Since the second derivative is always positive for s>0, there is a
relative minimum at s = 6. Since s = 6 is the only critical number, it yields an absolute minimum. When
s = 6, h =1.

16.5 A printed page must contain 60 cm2 of printed material. There are to be margins of 5 cm on either side and

amount of paper used?

I Let x be the length of the line and let y be the height of the printed material. Then xy = 60. The amount
of paper A = (x + W)(y + 6) = (x + 10)(60/x + 6) = 6(10 + x + 100/x + 10) = 6(20 +x + 100/x). x can be
any positive number. Then DXA = 6(1 - 100/x2) and D2/l = 1200/.X3. Solving 1 - 100/x2 = 0, we see
that the only critical number is 10. Since the second derivative is positive, there is a relative minimum at
x = 10, and, since this is the only critical number, there is an absolute minimum at x = 10.
A farmer wishes to fence in a rectangular field of 10,000 ft2. The north-south fences will cost $1.50 per foot, while
the east-west fences will cost $6.00 per foot. Find the dimensions of the field that will minimize the cost.
I Let x be the east-west dimension, and let y be the north-south dimension. Then xy = 10,000. The cost
C = 6(2x) + 1.5(2v) = 12x + 3y = Ux + 3( 10,000Ix) = Ux + 30,000/x. x can be any positive number. DXC =
12 -30,000/x2. D2C = 60,000/x3. Solving 12 - 30,000/x2 = 0, 2500 = x2, x = 50. Thus, 50 is the only
critical number. Since the second derivative is positive, there is a relative minimum at x = 50. Since this is the
only critical number, this is an absolute minimum. When x = 50, y = 200.
Find the dimensions of the closed cylindrical can that will have a capacity of k units of volume and will use the
minimum amount of material. Find the ratio of the height h to the radius r of the top and bottom.
I The volume k = irr2h. The amount of material M = 2irr2 + 2irrh. (This is the area of the top and
bottom, plus the lateral area.) So M = 2irr2 + 2irr(kiirr2) = 2irr2 + 2klr. Then DrM = 4trr - 2k/r2,
D2rM = 477 + 4k/r*. Solving 47rr - 2Jt/r2 = 0, we find that the only critical number is r = 3/kl2Tr. Since
the second derivative is positive, this yields a relative minimum, which, by the uniqueness of the critical number, is
an absolute minimum. Note that k = irr2h = Trr3(h/r) = ir(kl2it)(hlr). Hence, hlr = 2.
In Problem 16.7, find the ratio hlr that will minimize the amount of material used if the bottom and top of the can
have to be cut from square pieces of metal and the rest of these squares are wasted. Also find the resulting ratio
of height to radius.
I k=Trr2h. Now M = 8r2 + 2-irrh = 8r2 + 2irr(k/Trr2) = 8r2 + 2klr. D,M = 16r - 2k/r2. D2M = 16 +
4fc/r3. Solving for the critical number, r3 = k/8, r = 3/~ki2. As before, this yields an absolute minimum.
Again, k = irr2h = Trr\h/r) = ir(k/8)(h/r). So, h/r = 8/ir.

Solving 2r6-(108)2=0 for the critical number, r = 3V2. The first-derivative test yields the case {-,+},

16.10 A rectangular bin, open at the top, is required to contain 128 cubic meters. If the bottom is to be a square, at a
cost of $2 per square meter, while the sides cost $0.50 per square meter, what dimensions will minimize the cost?
I Let s be the side of the bottom square and let h be the height. Then 128 = s2h. The cost (in dollars)
C = 2r+ $(4sh) = 2s2 + 2s(U8/s2) = 2s~ + 256/5, so DSC = 4s - 256/s2, D;C = 4 + 512/53. Solving 4s-
256 /52 =0, s3 = 64, 5 = 4. Since the second derivative is positive, the critical number 5 = 4 yields a relative
minimum, which, by the uniqueness of the critical number, is an absolute minimum. When 5 = 4, h = 8.
16.11 The selling price P of an item is 100-0.02jc dollars, where x is the number of items produced per day. If the
cost C of producing and selling x items is 40* + 15,000 dollars per day, how many items should be produced
and sold every day in order to maximize the profit?
I The total income per day is jt(100- 0.02.x). Hence the profit G = x( 100 -0.02*) - (40* + 15,000) =
60x-0.02x2 - 15,000, and DAG = 60-0.04* and D2G =-0.04. Hence, the unique critical number is
the solution of 60 — 0.04x = 0, x = 1500. Since the second derivative is negative, this yields a relative
maximum, which, by the uniqueness of the critical number, is an absolute maximum.
16.12 Find the point(s) on the graph of 3*2 + \0xy + 3_y2 = 9 closest to the origin.
I It suffices to minimize u = x2 + y', the square of the distance from the origin. By implicit differentiation,
Dsu = 2x + 2yDJ[y and 6x + W(xDty + y) + dyDxy = 0. From the second equation, Dvv = -(3x + 5y)l
(5x + 3y), and, then, substituting in the first equation, Dxu = 2x + 2y[~(3x + 5y)/(5x + 3y)]. Setting
Dr«=0, x(5x + 3y) - y(3x + 5y) - 0, 5(x2 - y2) = 0, x2 = y2, x-±y. Substituting in the equation of  the
graph, 6*2 ± 10*2 = 9. Hence, we have the + sign, and 16*2 = 9, jc = ± f and _y=±|. Thus, the two
points closest to the origin are (j, j) and (-1, -1).

I Let R be the point where the boat lands, and let O be the center of the circle. Since AOPR is isosceles,
PR = 2cos0. The arc length RQ = 26. Hence, the time T= PR/1.5 + RQ/3 = | cosfl + §0. So, D
-!sin0+ \. Setting DeT=0, we find sin0= |, Q=Tt/6. Since T is a continuous function on the
closed interval [0, Tr/2], we can use the tabular method. List the critical number ir/6 and the endpoints 0 and
7T/2, and compute the corresponding values of T. The smallest of these values is the absolute minimum.
Clearly, 7r/3<3, and it is easy to check that 7r/3<(6V5 + IT) 19. (Assume the contrary and obtain the
false consequence that ir > 3V5.) Thus, the absolute minimum is attained when 0 — Tr/2. That means that
the man walks all the way.

16.14 Find the answer to Problem 16.13 when, instead of rowing, the man can paddle a canoe at 4 miles per hour.

DgT=0, We obtain sin 0=5, which is impossible. Hence, we use the tabular method for just the
endpoints 0 and itII. Then, since \ < ir/3, the absolute minimum is \, attained when 0 = 0. Hence, in
this case, the man paddles all the way.
A wire 16 feet long has to be formed into a rectangle. What dimensions should the rectangle have to maximize
the area?
I Let x and y be the dimensions. Then 16 = 2x + 2y, 8 = x + y. Thus, 0 s x < 8. The area A = xy =
x(8 — x) = Sx — x2, so DXA = 8 - 2x, D2XA = —2. Hence, the only critical number is x = 4. We can use
the tabular method. Then the maximum value 16 is attained when x = 4. When x = 4, y = 4. Thus, the
rectangle is a square.
16.16 Find the height h and radius r of a cylinder of greatest volume that can be cut within a sphere of radius b.
I The axis of the cylinder must lie on a diameter of the sphere. From Fig. 16-6, b2 = r2 + (h/2)2, so
the volume of the cylinder V= -rrr2h = Tr(b2 - H2/4)h = ir(b2h - A3/4). Then DhV= ir(b2 - 3h2/4) and
D2hV= -(3ir/2)h, so the critical number is h = 2b/V3. Since the second derivative is negative, there is a
relative maximum at h = 2ft/V3, which, by virtue of the uniqueness of the critical number, is an absolute
maximum. When h = 2b/V3, r = 6 VI •

the critical numbers are 0, 3, and 5. By the tabular method, the absolute maximum for P is 108, corresponding to

A solid steel cylinder is to be produced so that the sum of its height h and diameter 2r is to be at most 3 units.
Find the dimensions that will maximize its volume.
I We may assume that h + 2r = 3. So, 0<r<l. Then V= nr2h = i7T2(3 -2r) = 37rr2 -2irr*, so
DrV= 6-irr — birr2. Hence, the critical numbers are 0 and 1. We use the tabular method. The maximum value
TT is attained when r = 1. When r = 1, h = l.
Among all right triangles with fixed perimeter p, find the one with maximum area.
I Let the triangle A ABC have a right angle at C, and let the two sides have lengths x and y (Fig. 16-7). Then
the hypotenuse AB=p-x-y. Therefore, (p - x - y)2 = x2 + y2, so 2(p-x-y)(-l-D ty) = 2x +
2yD,y, D xy{(p - x - y) + y] = (-p + x - y) + x, Dxy(p - x) = y - p, Dxy = (y - p)l(p - x). Now, the
area A = \xy, DXA = \(xDxy + y) = \[x(y-p)l(p -x) + y] = ${[x(y-p) + y(p - x)]/(p - x)} = \[p(y -
x)l(p-x)}. Then, when DXA=Q, y = x, and the triangle is isosceles. Then, ( p - 2x)2 = 2x2,
p-2x = x^2, x=p/(2 + V2). Thus, the only critical number is x = p/(2 + V2). Since 0<*</?,
we can use the tabular method. When * = p/(2 + V2), y=p/(2 + V2), and A = \[p(2 + V2)]2.
When x = Q, A = Q. When x = p/2, y = 0 and A = 0. Hence, the maximum is attained when x =

D2C=1600/*3. Solving -1600/*2 + 2 = 0, *2 = 800, * = 20V2. Since the second derivative is positive,
this yields a relative minimum, which, by virtue of the uniqueness of the critical number, must be an absolute
minimum. Then the least cost is 1600/20V2 + 40V2 = 40V5 + 40V2 = 80V2, which is approximately $112.
A closed, right cylindrical container is to have a volume of 5000 in3. The material for the top and bottom of the
container will cost $2.50 per in2, while the material for the rest of the container will cost $4 per in2. How should
you choose the height h and the radius r in order to minimize the cost?
I 5000= 77T2/t. The lateral surface area is 2-rrrh. Hence, the cost C = 2(2.5Q)irr2 + 4(2irrh) = 5irr2 +
87r;7j = 5iTT2 + 87rr(5000/?rr2) = 57rr2+40,000/r. Hence, DrC= Wirr -40,000 /r2 and D2C = WTT +
(80,000/r3). Solving \Qirr- 40,000 /r2 = 0, we find the unique critical number r = lO^hr. ' Since the

The product of their cubes P = x3y3, so DXP = x\3y2Dxy) + 3*2y3 = x3[3y2(-x/y)] + 3x2y3 = -3x*y +
3x2y3 = 3*2y(—x2 + y ). Hence, when DXP = Q, either jc = 0 or y = 0 (and x = 2), or y = x
(and then, by x2+y2 = 4, x = V2). Thus, we have three critical numbers x = 0, x = 2, and x = V2.
Using the tabular method, with the endpoints 0 and 2, we find that the maximum value of P is achieved
when x = V2, y = V2.

Hence, DyS=—2y + l, D2yS = -2, so the critical number is y=\. Since the second derivative is

Find two nonnegative numbers x and y whose sum is 300 and for which x2y is a maximum.

I Let x be the width and y be the height of the page. Then 96 = xy, and (Fig. 16-10) the printed

I Let x be the width and y be the height of the page. Then 80 = xy, 0 = xDxy + y, Dxy = —ylx. The

I Let 5 be the side of the base and h be the height. Then V=s2h. We are told that 2400 = 8s2 + 2(4fo),
so 300 = s2 + hs, h = 3>00/s-s. Hence, V= s2(300/s - s) = 300s - s3. Then DSV= 300 -3s2, DS2V =

I The daily income is *(250-*), since 250-* is the price at which x units are sold. The profit
G = *(250 - x) - (250 + 90*) = 250x - x2 - 250 - 90x = 160* - x2 - 250. Hence, DXG = 160 -2x, D2XG =

unique critical number yields an absolute maximum. Notice that this maximum, taken over a continuous variable
x, is assumed for the integral value x = 80. So it certainly has to remain the maximum when x is restricted to
integral values (whole numbers of electronic components).
A gasoline station selling x gallons of fuel per month has fixed cost of $2500 and variable costs of 0.90*. The
demand function is 1.50 — 0.00002* and the station's capacity allows no more than 20,000 gallons to be sold per
month. Find the maximum profit.
I The price that x gallons can be sold at is the value of the demand function. Hence, the total income
is *(1.50- 0.00002*), and the profit G = *(1.50- 0.00002*) - 2500- 0.90* = 0.60* - 0.00002*2 - 2500.
Hence, DXG = 0.60 - 0.00004*, and D 2G = -0.00004. Solving DXG = 0, we find 0.60 = 0.00004*,
60,000 = 4*, x = 15,000. Since the second derivative is negative, the unique critical number * = 15,000

Maximize the volume of a box, open at the top, which has a square base and which is composed of 600 square
inches of material.
I Let s be the side of the base and h be the height. Then V=s2h. We are told that 600 = s2 + 4/w.
Hence, h = (600-s2)/4s. So V=s2[(600-s2)/4s] = (s/4)(600- s2) = 150s - Js3. Then DsV=150-i*2,
D2V=-|i. Solving DSV=0, we find 200 = s2, 10V2 = s. Since the second derivative is negative, this

f Let y be the length of the side adjoining the neighbor, and let * be the other dimension. Then

I Let * be the side of the square that is cut out. The length will be 8-2*, the width 3-2*, and
the height *. Hence, the volume V= *(3 - 2*)(8 - 2*); so D XV= (1)(3 - 2*)(8 - 2*) + *(-2)(8 - 2*) 
*(3-2*)(-2) = 4(3*-2)(*-3), and D2V=24*-44. Setting DXV=0, we find *=| or x = 3.
Since the width 3 of the cardboard is greater than 2*, we must have *<§. Hence, the value * = 3 is
impossible. Thus, we have a unique critical number * = I, and, for that value, the second derivative turns
out to be negative. Hence, that critical number determines an absolute maximum for the volume.

ir ~ !* and D2/=—|. Solving DXI = 0, A: = 65. Since the second derivative is negative, x = 65

16.41 A rectangle is inscribed in the ellipse *2/400 + y2/225 = 1 with its sides parallel to the axes of the ellipse (Fig.

I x/200 + (2y/225)D sy = 0, Dxy = -(9x/16y). The perimeter P = 4x+4y, so DxP = 4 + 4Dxy =

DrP = 0, I6y = 9x and, then, substituting in the equation of the ellipse, we find x2 = 256, x = 16, y = 9.

Find the dimensions of the right circular cylinder of maximum volume that can be inscribed in a right circular cone

I Let r and h be the radius and height of the cylinder. By similar triangles, r/(H-h) = R/H, r =
(RIH)(H-h). The volume of the cylinder V= Trr2h = ir(R2/H2)(H- h)2h. Then Dl,V=(trR2/H2)(H -

A = xy. The length of fencing is F = 3y + 2x = 3(A/x) + 2x. So, DXF= -3A/x2 + 2, and D*F =

I Let M be the x-coordinate of the leftmost vertex B of the rectangle on the x-axis. Then the y-coordinate of the
other two vertices is 4«. The x-coordinate of the vertex C opposite B is obtained by solving the equation
y=-5x + 6 for x when y=4u. This yields x = (6-4w)/5. Hence, this is the x-coordinate of the other
vertex D on the x-axis. Thus, the base of the rectangle is equal to (6-4u)/5 - u = (6-9u)/5. Therefore,
the area of the rectangle A =4w(6- 9u)/5 = f u - f u2. Then DUA = f 7 f u and D2uA = -%.
Solving DUA = 0, we find that the only positive critical number is M = 3. Since the second derivative is

Solving DyA = Q, we obtain x = y, P = (4 + TT)X, x = /V(4+7r). Since the second derivative is nega-
tive, this unique critical number yields the maximum area, so the side on which the semicircle rests is twice the

I Let x be the ^-coordinate of E. Let v be the y-coordinate of N. By similar triangles, ylb = xl(x - a),
y = bx/(x - a). Hence, the area A of ANOE is given by A = \x bxl(x -a) = (b!2)x2/(x - a). Using the
quotient rule, DXA = (b/2)(x2 - 2ax)/(x - a)2, and D2A = a2h/(x - a)3. Solving DXA = 0, we obtain
the critical number x = 2a. The second derivative is positive, since x> a is obviously necessary. Hence,
x = 2a yields the minimum area A. When x = 2a y = 2b.

How should the wire be divided to maximize or to minimize the sum of the areas of the square and triangle?
I Let x be the part used for the triangle. Then the side of the triangle is x/3 and its height is jcV3/6. Hence,
the area of the triangle is |(*/3)(*V3/6) = V3x2/36. The side of the square is (L-x)/4, and its area is
[(L - x) /4]2. Hence, the total area A = V3x2/36 + [(L - x) /4]2. Then DXA = xV3 /18 ~(L-x) IS. S
et-
ting DXA = 0, we obtain the critical number x = 9L/(9 + 4V5). Since 0<*<L, to find the maximum
and minimum values of A we need only compute the values of A at the critical number and the endpoints. It is
clear that, since 16 < 12V3 < 16 + 12V3, the maximum area corresponds to x = 0, where everything goes
into the square, and the minimum value corresponds to the critical number.

area is [(L-*)/4]2. So the total area A = x2/4ir + [(L - *)/4]2. Then DSA = x/2ir - %(L - x). Solv-
ing DXA = 0, we obtain the critical value x = irL/(4 + TT). Notice that 0<jc:<L. So, to obtain the

Rectilinear Motion
17.1 The equation of free fall of an object (under the influence of gravity alone) is s = s0 + vat — I6t2, where sa is the
initial position and va is the initial velocity at time t - 0. (We assume that the j-axis is directed upward away
from the earth, along the vertical line on which the object moves, with s =0 at the earth's surface, s is
measured in feet and t in seconds.) Show that, if an object is released from rest at any given height, it will have
dropped 16t2 feet after t seconds.
I To say that the object is released from rest means that the initial velocity v0 = 0, so its position after t
seconds is s0 — 16t2. The difference between that position and its initial position s0 is 16f2.
17.2 How many seconds does it take the object released from rest to fall 64 feet?
I By Problem 17.1, 64 = 16f2. Hence, t2 = 4, and, since t is positive, t = 2.
17.3 A rock is dropped down a well that is 256 feet deep. When will it hit the bottom of the well?
I If t is the time until it hits the bottom, 256 = 16f2, so t2 = 16, t = 4.
17.4 Assuming that one story of a building is 10 feet, with what speed, in miles per hour, does an object dropped from
the top of a 40-story building hit the ground?
f Let t be the time until the object hits the ground. Since the building is 400 feet tall, 400=16f2, t2 =25,
t = 5. The velocity v = D,s. Since s = s0 - I6t2, v = -32f. When t = 5, i; = -160. Thus, the speed
\v\ is 160ft/s. To change to mi/h, we calculate as follows:
In particular, when x = 160 ft/s, the speed is about 108.8 mi/h.
17.5 A rocket is shot straight up into the air with an initial velocity of 128 ft/s. How far has it traveled in 1 second?
I The height s = s0 + v0t - I6t2. Since s0 = 0 and v0 = 128, s = 128t-l6t2. When t=l, s = 112ft.
17.6 In Problem 17.5, when does the rocket reach its maximum height?
I At the maximum value of 5, v = D,s = 0, but v = 128 - 3>2t. Setting v = 0, we obtain t = 4 seconds.
17.7 In Problem 17.5, when does the rocket strike the ground again and what is its velocity when it hits the ground?
I Setting s = 0, 128t - I6t2 = 0, 16t(8 - t) = 0, / = 0 or t = 8. So the rocket strikes the ground again
after 8 seconds. When / = 8, the velocity v = 128- 32t= 128-256= -128 ft/s. The velocity is negative
(because the rocket is moving downward) and of the same magnitude as the initial velocity (see Problem 17.28).
17.8 A rock is thrown straight down from a height of 480 feet with an initial velocity of 16 ft/s. How long does it take
to hit the ground and with what speed does it hit the ground?
I The height s = s0 + v0t - I6t2. In this case, J0 = 480 and u0=-16. Thus, s = 480 - I6t - 16t2 =
16(30- t-t2) = 16(6+ t)(5-t). Setting 5 = 0, we obtain t=-6 or t = 5. Hence, the rock hits the
ground after 5 seconds. The velocity v = D,s = -16 - 32f. When t = 5, v = -16 - 160 = -176, so the
rock hits the ground with a speed of 176 ft/s. (The minus sign in the velocity indicates that the rock is moving
downward.)
17.9 Under the same conditions as in Problem 17.8, how long does it take before the rock is moving at a speed of
112 ft/s?
133

134 0 CHAPTER 17
I From Problem 17.8, we know that v = D,s = —16 — 32t. Since the rock is moving downward, a speed of
112 ft/s corresponds to a velocity v of -112. Setting -112=-16-32r, 32/ = 96, t = 3 seconds.
17.10 Under the same conditions as in Problem 17.8, when has the rock traveled a distance of 60 feet?
f Since the rock starts at a height of 480 feet, it has traveled 60 feet when it reaches a height of 420 feet.
Since s = 480 - 16f - 16f2, we set 420 = 480 - 16f - 16*2, obtaining 4t2 + 4f - 15 = 0, (It + 5)(2t - 3) = 0,
t=— 2.5 or f=1.5. Hence, the rock traveled 1.5 seconds.
17.11 An automobile moves along a straight highway, with its position 5 given by s = 12t3 - l&t2 + 9t- 1.5 (s in
feet, t in seconds). When is the car moving to the right, when to the left, and where and when does it change
direction?
I Since s increases as we move right, the car moves right when v = D,s>0, and moves left when
v = D,s<0. v= 36t2 -36t + 9 = 9(4f2 -4t + 1) = 9(2t- I)2. Since i; >0 (except at t = 0.5, where
i; = 0), the car always moves to the right and never changes direction. (It slows down to an instantaneous
velocity of 0 at t = 0.5 second, but then immediately speeds up again.)
17.12 Refer to Problem 17.11. What distance has the car traveled in the one second from t = 0 to t = 1?
I From the solution to Problem 17.11, we know that the car is always moving right. Hence, the distance
traveled from t = 0 to t = 1 is obtained by taking the difference between its position at time t = 1 and its
position at time t = 0: s(l) - s(0) = 1.5 - (-1.5) = 3ft.
17.13 The position of a moving object on a line is given by the formula s = (t — l)3(t — 5). When is the object moving
to the right, when is it moving left, when does it change direction, and when is it at rest? What is the farthest to
the left of the origin that it moves?
I v = D,s = (t-l)3 + 3(t-l)2(t-5) = (t-l)2[t-l + 3(t-5)] = 4(t-l)2(t-4). Thus, u>0 when t>
4, and v<0 when t<4 (except at t=l, when v = 0). Hence, the object is moving left when
t<4, and it is moving right when t>4. Thus, it changes direction when r = 4. It is never at rest. (To be
at rest means that s is constant for an interval of time, or, equivalently, that v = 0 for an entire interval of
time.) The object reaches its farthest position to the left when it changes direction at t = 4. When t = 4,
s = -27.

direction? When the particle is moving to the left, what is the maximum speed that it achieves?
I v = D,s = 4(t - I)2 + 2(t - l)(4f - 1) = 2(t - l)[2(t - 1) + 4t - 1] = 2(t - 1)(6( - 3) = 6(t - \)(2t - 1 ). Thus,
the key values are t = \ and ( = 0.5. When t>\, v>Q; when 0.5<«1, v<0; when f<0.5,
v>0. Thus, the particle is moving right when f<0.5 and when t>l. It is moving left when
0.5 < t< 1. So it changes direction when t = 0.5 and when t = 1. To find out what the particle's maximum
speed is when it is moving left, note that the speed is \v\. Hence, when v is negative, as it is when the particle is
moving left, the maximum speed is attained when the velocity reaches its absolute minimum. Now, D,v =
6[2(t- l) + 2f-l] = 6(4f-3), and D2v = 24>0. Hence, by the second derivative test, v reaches an
absolute minimum when t = 0.75 hour. When t = 0.75, i; = -0.75 mi/h. So the desired maximum speed
is 0.75 mi/h.
17.15 Under the assumptions of Problem 17.14, what is the total distance traveled by the particle from t = 0 to
f=l?
I The problem cannot be solved by simply finding the difference between the particle's positions at t = 1 and
t = 0, because it is moving in different directions during that period. We must add the distance dr traveled while
it is moving right (from t = 0 to t = 0.5) to the distance de traveled while it is moving left (from t = 0.5
to r=l). Now, dr = i(0.5) -s(0) = 0.25 -(-!) = 1.25. Similarly, dt = s(0.5) - s(l) = 0.25 -0 = 0.25.
Thus, the total distance is 1.5 miles.
17.16 A particle moves along the A:-axis according to the equation x = Wt - 2t2. What is the total distance covered by
the particle between t = 0 and t = 3?

RECTILINEAR MOTION 0 135
I The velocity i> = D,x = 10-4t. Thus, v>0 when t<2.5, and u<0 when t>2.5. Hence, the
particle is moving right for t < 2.5 and it is moving left for t > 2.5. The distance dr that it covers while it is
moving right from t = 0 to < = 2.5 is *(2.5) - ;t(0) = 12.5 -0= 12.5. The distance de that it covers while
it is moving left from t = 2.5 to t = 3 is *(2.5) - x(3) = 12.5 - 12 = 0.5. Hence, the total distan ce is
d, + </, = 12.5 + 0.5 = 13.
17.17 A rocket was shot straight up from the ground. What must its initial velocity have been if it returned to earth in
20 seconds?
I Its height s = s0 + v0t — 16f2. In this case, s0 = 0 and v0 is unknown, so s = v0t — 16t2. We are told
that s = 0 when t = 20. Hence, 0 = va(20) -16(20)2, u0 = 320ft/s.
17.18 Two particles move along the x-axis. Their positions f(t) and g(t) are given by f(t) = 6t — t2 and g(t) =
t2 — 4t. (a) When do they have the same position? (ft) When do they have the same velocity? (c) When they
have the same position, are they moving in the same direction?
I (a) Set 6t-t2 = t2-4t. Then t2-5t = 0, t(t-5) = 0, t = 0 or f = 5. (ft) The velocities are
f'(t) = 6-2t and g'(t) = 2t-4. Setting 6-2t = 2t-4, we have t = 2.5. (c) When they meet at
t = 0, f'(t)=f'(0) = 6 and g'(t) = g'(0)=-4. Since /'(O) and g'(0) have opposite signs, they are moving
in opposite directions when t = 0. When they meet at t = 5, f'(t)=f'(5)=-4 and g'(t) = g'(5) = 6.
Hence, when t = 5, they are moving in opposite directions.
17.19 A particle moves along the x-axis according to the equation x= j/3 - \ cos 2t + 3.5. Find the dist ance traveled
between t = 0 and t = ir/2.
I The velocity v = t2 + sin2t. For Q<t<irl2, sin2f>0, and, therefore, u>0. Hence, the particle
moves right between t = 0 and t = IT 12. So the distance traveled is x(irl2) - x(0) = (tr3/24 + 4) - 3 =
7T3/24+l.
17.20 A ball is thrown vertically into the air so that its height s after t seconds is given by
maximum height.
17.21 A particle moving along a straight line is accelerating at the constant rate of 3 m/s2. Find the initial velocity va if
the displacement during the first two seconds is 10 m.
I The acceleration a = D,v=3. Hence, v = 3t+C. When f = 0, v = v0. So C = v0. Thus, v =
3t+v0, but v = D,s. So s = \t2 + v0t + K. When t = 0, s = s0, the initial position, so K = sa.
Thus, s = \t2 + v0t + s0. The displacement during the first two seconds is s(2) - s(Q) = (6 + 2v0 + s0) — s0 =
6 + 2v0. Hence, 6 + 2u0 = 10, i;0 = 2m/s.
17.22 A particle moving on a line is at position s = t3 — 6t2 + 9t — 4 at time t. At which time(s) t, if any, does it
change direction?
I v = D,s = 3t2-I2t + 9 = 3(t2 -4t + 3) = 3(t- l)(f-3). Since the velocity changes sign at (=1 and
t = 3, the particle changes direction at those times.
17.23 A ball is thrown vertically upward. Its height 5 (in feet) after t seconds is given by s = 40t — I6t2. Find
(a) when the ball hits the ground, (ft) the instantaneous velocity at t = 1, (c) the maximum height.
I v = D,s = 40 - 32t, D2s = -32. (a) To find out when the ball hits the ground, we set s = 40t - 16(2 = 0.
Then t = 0 or f = 2.5. So the ball hits the ground .after 2.5 seconds, (ft) When t = l, u = 8ft/s. (c)
Set i>=40 — 32t = 0. Then f = 1.25. Since the second derivative is negative, this unique critical number
yields an absolute maximum. When f=1.25, s = 25ft.
17.24 A diver jumps off a springboard 10 feet above water with an initial upward velocity of 12ft/s. Find (a) her
maximum height, (ft) when she will hit the water, (c) her velocity when she hits the water.
Setting we obtain
Since the second derivative is negative, we must have a relative maximum at t = 9, and, since that is the unique
critical number, it must be an absolute maximum. At t = 9, 5 = 9.

A stone is dropped from the roof of a building 256 ft high. Two seconds later a second stone is thrown downward
from the roof of the same building with an initial velocity of v0 ft/s. If both stones hit the ground at the same
time, what is v0l
I For the first stone, j = 256 - I6t2. It hits the ground when 0 = s - 256 - 16?2, t2 = 16, t = 4 seconds.
Since the second stone was thrown 2 seconds later than the first and hit the ground at the same time as the first, the
second stone's flight took 2 seconds. So, for the second stone, 0 = 256 + va(2) - 16(2)2, v0 = -192 ft/s.

17.31 A woman standing on a bridge throws a stone straight up. Exactly 5 seconds later the stone passes the woman on

17.30
17.29
From Problem 17.27, we know that the object hits the ground u0/16 seconds after it was thrown. Hence,
With what velocity must an object be thrown straight up from the ground in order to reach a maximum height of h
feet?
With what velocity must an object be thrown straight up from the ground in order for it to hit the ground ?0 seconds
later?
I By Problem 17.27, the object hits the ground after i>0/16 seconds. At that time, v = v0 — 32? = va —
32(i>0/16) = —DO. Thus, the velocity when it hits the ground is the negative of the initial velocity, and, therefore,
the speeds are the same.
17.28 Under the conditions of Problem 17.27, show that the object hits the ground with the same speed at which it was
initially thrown.
I s = s0 + v0t - I6t2. In this case, s0 = 0. So s = v0t - 16?2, v = D,s = v0-32t, a = D,v = D2s = -32.
So the unique critical number is t = i>0/32, and, since the second derivative is negative, this yields the
maximum height. Thus, the time of the upward flight is i>0/32. The object hits the ground again when
s = v0t — I6t2 = 0, v0 = 16?, t = u0/16. Hence, the total time of the flight was i>0/16, and half of that time,
i>0/32, was used up in the upward flight. Hence, the time taken on the way down was also D0/32.
17.27
f Since she is moving only under the influence of gravity, her height s = s0 + v0t — 16?2. In this case, sa = 10
and va = 12. So 5 = 10 + 12? - 16?2, v = D,s = 12 - 32?, D2s = -32. (a) Setting v=Q, we obtain
t = 0.375. Since the second derivative is negative, this unique critical number yields an absolute maximum.
When ? = 0.375, s = 16.75 ft. (ft) To find when she hits the water, set s = 10+ 12? - 16r2 =0. So (5-
40(1 + 20 = 0, and, therefore, she hits the water at ? = 1.25 seconds, (c) At ? = 1.25, c=-28 ft/s.
A ball is thrown vertically upward. Its height s (in feet) after t seconds is given by s - 48? - 16?2. For which
values of ? will the height exceed 32 feet?
I We must have 48?-16?2>32, 3?-?2>2, ?2-3? + 2<0, (?-2)(?-1) <0. The latter inequality
holds precisely when 1< ? < 2.
The distance a locomotive is from a fixed point on a straight track at time ? is given by s = 3?4 - 44?3 + 144?2.
When was it in reverse?
I u = D,s = 12?3-132?2 + 288?=12?(?2-ll? + 24) = 12?(?-3)(?-8). The locomotive goes backwards
when v<0. Clearly, v>0 when ?>8; u<0 when 3<?<8; v>Q when 0<?<3; v <0 when
t < 0. Thus, it was in reverse when 3 < ? < 8 (and, if we allow negative time, when ? < 0).
An object is thrown straight up from the ground with an initial velocity v0 ft/s. Show that the time taken on the
upward flight is equal to the time taken on the way down.

17.26
I The height of the stone s = sa + v0t— I6t2, where sa is the height of the bridge above the water. When
t = 5, s = s0. So sa = s0 + v0(5) - 16(5)2, 5i;0 = 400, u0 = 80ft/s. Hence, 5 = s0 + SOt - 16t2. When
t = 6, s=0. So 0 = s0 + 80(6) - 16(6)2, s0 = 96ft.
f From Problem 17.27, we know that the object reaches its maximum height after i>0/32 seconds. When
t=va/32, s = vat-16t2 = v20/64. Hence, h = v20/64, v0 = 8VK.

An object is dropped from a height 25 ft above the ground. At the same time another object is thrown straight
down from a height 50 ft above the ground. Both objects hit the ground at the same time. Find the initial
velocity of the second object.
I For the first object, s = 25 - I6t2. When s = 0, t = f. For the second object, 5 = 50 + vnt - 16t2.
Since the second object also hits the ground after f seconds,
If the position s of an object moving on a straight line is given by show that its velocity is positive,
and its acceleration is negative and proportional to the cube of the velocity.
The velocity and the acceleration
An object moves along the jt-axis so that its ^-coordinate obeys the law x = 3f3 + 8t + 1. Find the time(s) when
its velocity and acceleration are equal.
Setting v = a, 9t2 + 8 = 18t, 9t2 - 18t + 8 = 0, (3f-2)(3f-4) = 0,v = D,x = 9t2 + 8. a = D,v = I8t.

Let f(x) = \IVx, A: = 16, A;c = -l. Then f'(x) = -l/2(VI)3 = -1/128, and Ay = 1 /VT5- 1 /Vl6 =

Let f(x) = sin x, x = 30°, AJC = -2° =- Tr/90 radians. Then /'(*) = cos x = V3/2 ==0.8660, and
Ay = sin 28° - sin 30° = sin 28° - {. By the approximation principle, sin 28° - k = 0.8660(- 77/90) = -0.0302.
So sin 28° = | - 0.0302 = 0.4698. (The correct figure is 0.4695 to four decimal"places.)

19.33 Find an equation of the curve passing through the point (0,1) and having slope I2x + 1 at any point (x, y).
Dxy = 12x + l. Hence, y = 6x2 + x + C. Since (0,1) lies on the curve, 1 = C. Thus, y = 6x2 + x + 1
is the equation of the curve.
19.34 A particle moves along the *-axis with acceleration a = 2r-3ft/s2. At time t = 0 it is at the origin and
moving with a speed of 4ft/s in the positive direction. Find formulas for its velocity v and position s, and
determine where it changes direction and where it is moving to the left.
D,v = a=2t- 3. So, v = J (2t-3) dt = t2 - 3t + C. Since v = 4 when t = 0, C = 4. Thus, v =
t2-3t + 4. Since v = D,s, s = J (t2 -3t + 4) dt = ^t3 - \t2 + 4t + C,. Since s=0 when f = 0, C,=0.
Thus, 5 = |?3 — \t2 + 4t. Changes of direction occur where 5 reaches a relative maximum or minimum. To
look for critical numbers for 5, we set v = 0. The quadratic formula shows that v = 0 has no real roots.
[Alternatively, note that t2 — 3/ + 4 = (t - | )2 + J > 0.] Hence, the particle never changes direction. Since it
is moving to the right at t = 0, it always moves to the right.
19.35 Rework Problem 19.34 when the acceleration a = t2 - " ft/s2.
v = S(t2-¥)dt=$t3-%t+C. Since u=4 when t = 0, C = 4. Thus, u=|f3-fr + 4. Then
s = fvdt= |-|f4- ¥• ^2 + 4/+C, = T^4-fr2 + 4f+C,. Since s = 0 when t = 0, C\=0. Thus, s =
n/4-T*2 + 4f. To find critical numbers for s, we set i> = 0, obtaining t3 - 13^ + 12 = 0. Clearly, f = l is a
root. Dividing t3-13t+l2 by f-1, we obtain t2 + t- 12 = (t + 4)(t - 3). Thus, r = 3 and f =-4
also are critical numbers. When t = \, D2i = a = -^<0. Hence, s has a relative maximum at t = \.
Similarly, a= " >0 when t = 3, and, therefore, 5 has a relative minimum at t = 3; a=T>0 when
t = -4, and, therefore, s has a relative minimum at t= -4. Hence, the particle changes direction at t= -4,
t = 1, and f = 3. It moves left for t< -4, where it reaches a minimum; it moves right from t= —4 to
t=l, where it reaches a maximum; it moves left from t = \ to f = 3, where it reaches a minimum; then it
moves right for f > 3.
19.36 A motorist applies the brakes on a car moving at 45 miles per hour on a straight road, and the brakes cause a
constant deceleration of 22 ft/s . In how many seconds will the car stop, and how many feet will the car have
traveled after the time the brakes were applied?
Let t = 0 be the time the brakes were applied, let the positive s direction be the direction that the car was
traveling, and let the origin 5 = 0 be the point at which the brakes were applied. Then the acceleration
a =—22. So, v = J a dt= -22t + C. The velocity at t = 0 was 45 mi/h, which is the same as
66ft/s: Hence, C = 66. Thus, v = ~22t + 66. Then s = J v dt = -llr + 66f + C,. Since .$ = 0 when
t-0, C, =0 and s = -llt2 + 66t. The car stops when v=0, that is, when t = 3. At t = 3, s =
99. So, the car stops in 3 seconds and travels 99 feet during that time.
19.37 A particle moving on a straight line has acceleration a = 5 — 3t, and its velocity is 7 at time t = 2. lts(t)\s
the distance from the origin, find 5(2) — s(l).
v = $adt = 5t-ll2 + C. Since the velocity is 7 when t = 2, 7 = 10-6+C, C = 3. So, v = 5t -
|<2 + 3. Then s = \t2 - JV3 + 3r + C,. Hence, s(2)=12+C,, s(l) = 5 + Ct, and s(2)-s(l) = 7.
19.38 Find an equation of the curve passing through the point (3, 2) and having slope 2x2 — 5 at any point (x, y).
D:cy = 2x2-5. Hence, y = I*3 - 5x + C. Since (3, 2) is on the curve, 2= |(3)3-5(3) + C, C=-l.
Thus, y = |jc3 - 5x — 1 is an equation of the curve.
19.39 A particle is moving along a line with acceleration a = sin2r+ t2 ft/s2. At time / = 0, its velocity is 3 ft/s.
What is the distance between the particle's location at time t = 0 and its location at time t = ir/2, and what
is the particle's speed at time / = tr/21
v = J adt= -\ cos2f + j/3 + C. Since v = 3 when f = 0, C = 3. Thus, v = -\ cos2/ + \f + 3.
Hence, at time t=-rr/2, v = - \ cos IT + |(7r/2)3 + 3 = \ + w3/24. Its position s = J i; dt = - \ sin2r +
^- Jf4 + 3f+C, = -Jsin2;+ i(4 + 3f+C,. Then j(0) = Cl and i(w/2) = - | sin TT + A(^/2)4 +
3(7r/2)+d. Hence, 5(77/2) - s(O) = (77"+2887r)/192.

19.41 Suppose that a particle moves along the *-axis and its velocity at time fis given by v = t2-t — 2 for l<r<4.
Find the total distance traveled in the period from t = 1 to t = 4.
v = (t-2)(t + 1). Hence, u=0 when t = 2 or /=-!. Since a = D,v = 2t-l is equal to 3
when t = 2, the position s of the particle is a relative minimum when t = 2. So, the particle moves to the left
from t=\ to t = 2, and to the right from t = 2 to / = 4. Now, 5 = J v dt = $t* - ^t2 - 2t + C. By
direct computation, s(l) = -•£ + C, s(2) = - f + C and s(4) = f + C. Hence, the distance traveled
from t=l to t = 2 is \s(l) - s(2)\ = I and the distance traveled from t = 2 to f = 4 is |s(2)-
s(4)| = T. Thus, the total distance traveled is f.

19.44 A particle moving along a straight line is accelerating at the rate of 3 ft/s2. Find the initial velocity if the distance

v = $3dt = 3t+C. C is the initial velocity i>0 when t = Q. Thus, v = 3t + va. The position 5 =
Judf= It2 + v0t+ C,. Hence, s(2) = | -4 + 2v0 + Cl =6 + 2v0 + C,. On the other hand, s(0)=C,. So,
10 = 5(2) -5(0) = 6 + 2u0, i>0 = 2ft/s.

19.59 A space ship is moving in a straight line at 36,000 miles per second. Suddenly it accelerates at a = I8t mi/s2.
Assume that the speed of light is 180,000 mi/s and that relativistic effects do not influence the velocity of the space
ship. How long does it take the ship to reach the speed of light and how far does it travel during that time?
v = J a dt = J 18/ dt = 9r + C. Let r = 0 be the time at which the ship begins to accelerate. Then
y = 36,000 when t = 0, and, therefore, C = 36,000. Setting 9r + 36,000 = 180,000, we find that t2 =
16,000, r = 40VTO. The position s = J v dt = 3f3 + 36,000r + s0, where s0 is the position at time r = 0.
The position at time t = 40VTS is 3r(r + 12,000) + sn = 120VIO(28,000) + s0. Hence, the distance traveled

19.70 Find the equation of a curve such that y" is always 2 and, at the point (2,6), the slope of the tangent line is 10.
y' = \y"dx = $2dx = 2x + C. When x = 2, y'= 10; so, 10 = 4 + C, C = 6, y' = 2x + 6. Hence,
y = / y' dx = x2 + 6x + C,. When x = 2, y = 6; thus, 6 = 16 + C,, C, = -10, y = x2 + 6x - 10.

19.72 A car is slowing down at the rate of 0.8 ft/s2. How far will the car move before it stops if its speed was initially

J u rff = -0.4r2 + 22f + su, where sa is the initial position. Hence, the distance traveled in 27.5 seconds is

19.74 If a particle starts from rest, what constant acceleration is required to move the particle 50 mm in 5 s along a

v = J a dt = at + va. Since the particle starts from rest, i>0 = 0, v = at. Then s = J v dt = \at2. [We

19.75 What constant deceleration is needed to slow a particle from a velocity of 45 ft/s to a dead stop in 15 ft?

The deceleration a = -4. v = J a dt = -4t + va. When f = 0, v = 10; hence, v0 = 10, v =-4t +
10. Then the position s = J v dt = — 2t2 + Wt [We assume s = 0 when f = 0.] The ball stops when
u = 0, that is, when t = 2.5. Hence, the distance rolled is -2(2.5)2 + 10(2.5) = 12.5 ft.

seconds at a horizontal distance from the foot of the tower equal to three times the height of the tower. Find the
height of the tower.
Let h be the height, in feet, of the tower. The height of the rocket s=h+v0t-16t2, where v0 is the
vertical component of the initial velocity. When ( = 5, s = 0. So, 0 = h + 5v0 -400, v0 = (400- h)/5.
Since the angle of projection is 45°, the horizontal component of the velocity has the initial value v0, and this value
is maintained. Hence, the horizontal distance covered in 5 seconds is 5v0. Thus, 5[(400- h)/5] = 3h,

y = 2 or y=-3. Thus, the points of intersection are (-4,2) and (-9,-3). It is more convenient to
integrate with respect to y, with the parabola as the upper boundary and the line as the lower boundary. The

3) = 0, AC = 0 or jt = 3. Hence, the points of intersection are (0,0) and (3,9). The second parabola
y= -x2 + 6x = -(x2 -6x)= -[(*-3)2 -9] = -(jtr-3)2 + 9 has its vertex at (3,9), x = 3 is its axis of

or x = 1. Thus, the intersection points are (0,0) and (1,0). The parabola y = x2 - x = (x - \ )2 - \ has
its vertex at ( \, - \ ) and opens upward, while y = x - x2 has its vertex at (|, J) and opens downward. The
latter parabola is the upper boundary, and the first parabola is the lower boundary. Hence, the area is

See Fig. 21-16. Let us find the points of intersection: x* = x1, x4 - x2 = 0, x2(x2 - 1) = 0, * = 0 or
x = ±1. So, the intersection points in the first quadrant are (0,0) and (1,1). y = x2 is the upper curve.

21.27 Find the area of the bounded region between the curve y = x3 — 6x2 + 8x and the x-axis.
y = x3 - 6x2 + 8x = x(x2 - 6x + 8) = x(x - 2)(x - 4). So, the curve cuts the x-axis at x = 0, x = 2, and
x = 4. Since Km f(x) = +°° and lim f(x) = —<*, the graph can be roughly sketched as in Fig. 21-22.
Hence the required area is A, + A2 = Jo (x3 - 6x2 + 8x) dx + J2 - (x3 - 6x2 + 8x)dx = ( \x4 - 2x3 + 4x2) ]„ -

See Fig. 21-20. y = 3x2 - 2x = 3(x2 - \x) = 3[(* - \)2 - 5] = 3(x - |)2 - \. Thus, that curve is a parabola
with vertex (i,-j)- To find the intersection, let 3x2 - 2x = 1 - 4x, 3x2 + 2x - 1 = 0, (3x - l)(x + 1) = 0,
x= j or x=—\. Hence, the intersection points are (5, —3) and (—1,5). Thus, the area is Jlj3 [(1 —
4X)-(3XX)]dx = S1-?(l-2x-3x2)dX = (X-X)]^ = (li-%-lf)-(-l-l + l)=%.
See Fig. 21-21. The parabola y = x2 - 4x = (x - 2)2 - 4 has vertex (2, -4). Let us find the intersection
of the curves: x2 — 4x = —x, x2 — 3x = 0, x(x — 3) = 0, x = 0 or x = 3. So, the points of intersection
are (0,0) and (3, -3). Hence, the area is J03 [-x - (x2 - 4x)] dx = J03 (3* - x2) dx = (|x2 - 3x3) ]3 = ¥ -

As shown in Fig. 21-19, the region consists of two pieces, one below the *-axis from x = Q to x = 1,

For y = x3 — 3x, y' = 3x — 3 = 3(x - l)(x + 1), and y" = 6x. Hence, the critical number x = \
yields a relative minimum, and the critical number x=—\ yields a relative maximum. Setting x3 — 3>x = x,
x3 = 4x, x = 0 or x = ±2. Hence, the intersection points are (0,0), (2, 2), and (-2, -2). Thus, the region
consists of two equal pieces, as shown in Fig. 21-29. The piece between x = -2 and x = 0 has area
J!2 [(x3 - 3x) -x)]dx = J!2 (*3 - 4x) dx = (i*4 - 2x2) ]°_2 = -(4 - 8) = 4. So the tota l area is 8.

where this line intersects y = x3, we solve x3 = 3x - 2, or x3 - 3x + 2 = 0. One root is x = 1 (the
point of tangency). Dividing x3-3x + 2 by x = l, we obtain x2 + x -2 = (x + 2)(x -1). Hence,
x = — 2 is a root, and, therefore, the intersection points are (1,1) and (—2, —8). Hence, the required area is

y = x3 lies above y = x-l for l<;t<2 (see Fig. 22-19). So, we can use the circular ring formula:

Solving y = 2* - 4 and y2 = 4x simultaneously, we obtain y2 — 2y — 8 = 0, y = 4 or y = —2.
Thus, the curves intersect at (4,4) and (1, -2), as shown in Fig. 22-18. We integrate along the y-axis, using
the circular ring formula:
22.31 Same as Problem 22.30, but revolving about the y-axis.

Solving y = x2-4x + 6 and y = x + 2, we obtain x2-5x + 4 = Q, x = 4 or x=l. So, the
curves meet at (4,6) and (1,3). Note that y = x2 - 4x + 6 = (x -2)2 + 2. Hence, the latter curve is a
parabola with vertex (2, 2) (see Fig. 22-20). We use the circular ring formula: V= TT J7 {(x + 2)2 - [(x - 2)2 +

Solving 9 - x2 =2*+ 6, we get x2 + 2*-3 = 0, (.v + 3)(* - 1) = 0, x = -3 or x = l. Thus, the
curves meet at (1,8) and (-3,0). Then V= 77 J13 [(9 - x2)2 - (2x + 6)2] dx = 77 J13 (81 - 18*2 + x* - 4x2 -

By symmetry, we need only double the volume generated by the piece in the first quadrant. We

Solving 12 - x3 = 12 - 4x, we get x = 0 and x = ±2. So, the curves intersect at (0,12), (2, 4), and
(-2,20). The region consists of two pieces as shown in Fig. 22-21. By the circular ring formula, the piece in the

The area A(x) of the dashed square in Fig. 22-27 is 4(r2 - x2). Hence the volume will be S/TT times that

22.54 The base of a solid is the circle x2 + y2 = 16*, and every planar section perpendicular to the jr-axis is a rectangle
whose height is twice the distance of the plane of the section from the origin. Find the volume of the solid.
Refer to Fig. 22-29. By completing the square, we see that the equation of the circle is (x - 8)2 + yz = 64.
So, the center is (8,0) and the radius is 8. The height of each rectangle is 2x, and its base is 2y =
2V64 - (A- - 8)2. So, the area A(x) is 4x^/64 - (x - 8)2. By the cross-section formula, V= 4 J016 jc[64 -
(;t-8)2]"2 dx. Let M = jc-8, x = u + 8, du = dx. Then V=4 Jfg (« + 8)(64- ir)"2 d« = 4 J!8 u(64 -
H2)"2 dw + 32 J!8 (64 - u2)"2 du. The integral in the first summand is 0, since its integrand is an odd function.
The integrand in the second summand is the area, 3277, of a semicircle of radius 8 (by Problem 20.71). Hence,
V= 32(327r) = 102477.
22.55 The section of a certain solid cut by any plane perpendicular to the jc-axis is a square with the ends of a diagonal
lying on the parabolas y2=9x and x2 =9y (see Fig. 22-30). Find its volume.
The parabolas intersect at (0,0) and (9, 9). The diagonal d of the square is 3*"2 - §jt2 = $(27;c"2 - x2).
Then the area of the square is A(x) = \d2 = ^ [(27)2x - 54x5'2 + x4], and the cross-section formula yields the
volume K= jfe /09 [(27)2* - 54jc5'2 + x4] dx = Tfe((27)2 • {x2 - ^x"2 + i*5) ft = |(81)2.
Let the *-axis be the fixed diameter, with the center of the circle as the origin. Then the radius of the
semicircle at abscissa x is V/-2 - x2 (see Fig. 22-27), and, therefore, its area A(x) is \TT(T* - x1). The
cross-section formula yields V= \'_r A(x) dx = ±TT fr_r (r2 - x2) dx = ±ir(r2x - $x3) ]r_r = ±ir[(r3 - ^r3) -
(-r*+$r3)}=t7rr\
The area A(x) of the dashed triangle in Fig. 22-27 (which is inscribed in the semicircle) is
j(2Vr2 - A-2)(Vr - x2) = r2 - x2. Hence the volume will be one-fourth that of Problem 22.51, or 4/-3/3.

See Fig. 22-31. The altitude h = b cos 30° = \bV3. For each x, y = x tan 30° = (1A/3)*. Hence, the
side of the square is 2y = (2/V3)x and its area is A= \x2. Hence, the cross-section formula yields

Refer to Fig. 22-32. The required volume is given by the disk formula as V = TT J0 2 r2 ds; so our strategy

A bacteria culture grows exponentially so that the initial number has doubled in 3 hours. How many times the

In 2 = In e3* = 3K, K = (ln2)/3. When f = 9, y = y0e9K = y0e^"2 = y0(ela2)3 = ya -23 = 8y0. Thus, the

A certain chemical decomposes exponentially. Assume that 200 grams becomes 50 grams in 1 hour. How much

Show that, when a quantity grows or decays exponentially, the rate of increase over a fixed time interval is
constant (that is, it depends only on the time interval, not on the time at which the interval begins).
The formula for the quantity is y = y0eKl. Let A be a fixed time interval, and let t be any time. Then
y(t + A)/y(0 = yaeK('+^/y0eK> = e*A, which does not depend on t.

If an amount of money earning 8 percent per year is compounded quarterly, what is the equivalent yearly rate of

By Problem 26.8, the amount present after 1 year will be Thus, the
equivalent yearly rate is 8.24 percent.
If an amount of money earning 8 percent per year is compounded 10 times per year, what is the equivalent yearly
rate of return?
By Problem 26.8, the amount after 1 year will be .y0(H-Tggg)10 = 3>0(1.008)IO = 1.0829>>. Thus, the
equivalent yearly rate is 8.29 percent.
If an amount of money receiving interest of 8 percent per year is compounded continuously, what is the equivalent
yearly rate of return?
By Problem 26.9, the amount after 1 year will be yae° °8, which, by a table of values of e*, is approximately
l.OS33y0. Hence, the equivalent yearly rate is about 8.33 percent.
A sum of money, compounded continuously, is multiplied by 5 in 8 years. If it amounts to $10,000 after 24 years,
what was the initial sum of money?
Hence, the initial quantity y0 was 80 dollars.
If a quantity of money, earning interest compounded continuously, is worth 55 times the initial amount after 100

If radioactive carbon-14 has a half-life of 5750 years, what will remain of 1 gram after 3000 years?

If 20 percent of a radioactive element disappears in 1 year, compute its half-life.
Let yn be the original amount, and let T be the half-life. Then 0.8y0 remains when t = 1. Thus,
0.&y0 = y0e, 0.8 = eK, K = In 0.8 « -0.2231 (from a table of logarithms). But KT = -In 2= -0.6931.
So -0.2231 T= -0.6931, 7=3.1067 years.
Fruit flies are being bred in an enclosure that can hold a maximum of 640 flies. If the flies multiply exponentially,
with a growth constant K = 0.05 and where time is measured in days, how long will it take an initial population
of 20 to fill the enclosure?
So
By the formula of Problem 26.9, y = y0e0'airk, where r is the rate of interest and k is the number of
years. Hence, 5y0 = y0e°'"*', 5 = e°08'. After 24 years, 10,000 = y0e°024r = ^0(e°-08r)3 = >-0(5)3 = 125>-0.

The number of bacteria in a certain culture is growing exponentially. If 100 bacteria are present initially and 400
are present after 1 hour, how many bacteria are present after 31 hours?
The growth equation is y = 100eKt. The given information tells us that 400 = 100eK, 4 = eK. At
t = 3.5, y = !OOe3iK = 100(e*)3 5 = 100(4)7'2 = 100(2)7 = 100(128) = 12,800.
A certain radioactive substance has a half-life of 3 years. If 10 grams are present initially, how much of the
substance remains after 9 years?
Since 9 years is three half-lifes, ( \ )310 = 1.25 grams will remain.
If y represents the amount by which the temperature of a body exceeds that of the surrounding air, then the rate at
which y decreases is proportional to y (Newton's law of cooling). Ify was initially 8 degrees and was 7 degrees

Since D,y = Ky, y = y0eK> = 8eKl. The given facts tell us that 7 = 8eK, eK=\. When f = 2, y =

If the population of Latin America has a doubling time of 27 years, by what percent does it grow per year?
The population y = y0eKl. By the given information, 2y0 = y0e27K, 2=e27A:, eK = V2« 1.0234. By
the solution to Problem 26.6, the percentage increase per year r = 100(e* -1) = 100(1.0234 - 1) = 2.34.
If in 1980 the population of the United States was 225 million and increasing exponentially with a growth constant
of 0.007, and the population of Mexico was 62 million and increasing exponentially with a growth constant of

Fhe United States' population yu = 225e° °07', and Mexico's population yM = 62e° °24'. When they are

In a chemical reaction, a compound decomposes exponentially. If it is found by experiment that 8 grams
diminishes to 4 grams in 2 hours, when will 1 gram be left?
The half-life is 2 hours. n = 3. Thus 1 gram remains after three half-lifes, or 6 hours.
A tank initially contains 400 gallons of brine in which 100 pounds of salt are dissolved. Pure water is running into
the tank at the rate of 20 gallons per minute, and the mixture (which is kept uniform by stirring) is drained off at
the same rate. How many pounds of salt remain in the tank after 30 minutes?
Let y be the number of pounds of salt in the mixture at time t. Since the concentration of salt at any given
time is y/400 pounds per gallon, and 20 gallons flow out per minute, the rate at which y is diminishing is
20-y/400 = 0.05y pounds per minute. Hence, Dty = — 0.05y, and, thus, y is decaying exponentially with a
decay constant of-0.05. Hence, y = 100e~° °5'. So, after 30 minutes, y = WOe'15 = 100(0.2231) = 22.31
pounds.
Solve Problem 26.34 with the modification that instead of pure water, brine containing ^ pound per gallon is run
into the tank at 20 gallons per minute, the mixture being drained off at the same rate.
As before, the tank is losing salt at the rate of O.OSy pounds per minute. However, it is also gaining
salt at the rate of pounds per minute. Hence,

A country has 5 billion dollars of paper money in circulation. Each day 30 million dollars is brought into the
banks for deposit and the same amount is paid out. The government decides to issue new paper money;
whenever the old money comes into the banks, it is destroyed and replaced by the new money. How long will it
take for the paper money in circulation to become 90 percent new?
Let y be the number of millions of dollars in old money. Each day, (y/5000)- 30 = 0.006}' millions of
dollars of old money is turned in at the banks. Hence, D,y = —0.006y, and, thus, y is decreasing
exponentially, with a decay constant of —0.006. Hence, y = 5000e~°'006'. When 90 percent of the money is

If money is invested at 5 percent, compounded continuously, in how many years will it double in value?
Show that if interest is compounded continuously at an annual percentage r the effective annual percentage rate of
interest is 100(e°Olr - 1).
Let s be the effective annual percentage rate. Then y0e°'olr = y0(l + 0.01s). So e°'olr = 1 + 0.01s,
0.01s = eoolr-l, s = 100(eoolr-l).
2y0 = y0e°-05', by Problem 26.9. So 2 = e005', 0.05/ = ln2, t = 20 In 2 = 20(0.6931) = 13.862. Thus,
the money will double in a little less than 13 years and 315 days.
An object cools from 120 to 95°F in half an hour when surrounded by air whose temperature is 70°F. Use
Newton's law of cooling (Problem 26.22) to find its temperature at the end of another half an hour.
The earth weighs 6.586 x 1021 x 2000 pounds. When this is equal to the weight of y billion people,
120 x 10"y = 6.586 x 1021 x 2000, or y = l.lxl014. Thus we must solve 1.1 x 1014 = 3.6e002' for (.
Taking logarithms, In 1.1 + 14 In 10 = In 3.6 + 0.02f, 0.02f = 31.05, t*= 1552.5 years. The date would be
1970 + 1552 = 3522.
Let y be the difference in temperature between the object and the air. By Newton's law, y = y0eKt.
When t = \,Since y0 = 120 - 70 = 50, y = 50e . At
y = 50e* = 50 Hence, the temperature of the object is 70 + 12.5 = 82.5°F.
What is the present value of a sum of money which if invested at 5 percent interest, continuously compounded, will
become $1000 in 10 years?
Let y be the value of the money at time t, and let y0 be its present value. Then, by Problem 26.9,
y = y0e005'. In 10 years, 1000 = y0e° 05(10) = y0e05. So y0 = 1000/e05 = 1000/1.64872 = 606.53. Hence,
the present value is about $606.53.
y = y«eK'- We are told that y = 2ya when t-l. Hence, 2y0 = y0e*, 2 = eK. If we start with

Use integration to show that the circumference of a circle of radius r is 2 TIT.
Find the arc length of the part of the circle x + y2 = r2 in the first quadrant and multiply it by 4. Since
y = Vr2-x\ y' = -x/Vr2-x2 and (y')2 = x2/(r2 - x2). So 1 +(y1)2 = 1+x2/(r2 - x2) = (r2 ~ x2 +
x2)/(r2 - x2) = r2/(r2 - x2). Thus,

Planar Vectors
33.1 Find the vector from the point ,4(1, -2) to the point B (3, 7).
The vector AB = (3 - 1,7 - (-2)) = (2, 9). In general, the vector P,P2 from />,(*,, ;y,) to P2(x2, y,) is
(*2-.v,, y2-yt).
33.2 Given vectors A = (2,4) and C = (-3,8), find A + C, A-C, and 3A.
By componentwise addition, subtraction, and scalar multiplication, A + C = (2 + (—3), 4 + 8) = (— 1.12),
A-C = (2-(-3), 4-8) = (5,-4), and 3A = (3-2, 3-4) = (6, 12).
33.3 Given A = 3i + 4j and C = 2i-j, find the magnitude and direction of A + C.
A + C = 5i + 3j. Therefore, |A + C| = V(5)2 + (3)2 = V34. If S is the angle made by A + C with the
positive *-axis, tan 0 = f. From a table of tangents, 0 = 30° 58'.
33.4 Describe a method for resolving a vector A into components A, and A2 that are, respectively, parallel and
perpendicular to a given nonzero vector B.
A = A,+A2, Aj=cB, A2-B = 0. So, A2 = A - A, = A - cB, 0 = A2-B = (A - cB) • B = A-B - c|B|.
Hence, c = (A-B)/|B|2. Therefore, A: = B, and A2 = A - cB = A - B. Here, (A-B)/|B|
is the scalar projection of A on B, and = A, is the vector projection of A on B.
33.5 Resolve A = (4,3) into components A, and A2 that are, respectively, parallel and perpendicular to B =
(3,1).
From Problem 33.4 c = (A-B)/|B|2 = [(4-3) + (3-1)/10] = 3. So, A, = cB = |(3,1) = (f, f) and
A2 = A-A1 = (4,3)-(l,|) = (-i,l).
33.6 Show that the vector A = (a,fe) is perpendicular to the line ax + by + c = 0.
Let P,(AT,, _y,) and P2(x2, y2) be two points on the line. Then ax, + byt + c = 0 and ox, + by2 + c = 0.
By subtraction, a(jc, - x2) + b(yl - y2) = 0, or (a, b) • (xl - x2, yl - y2) = 0. Thus, (a, b) • P,P, = 0,
(a, 6)1 P2Pt- (Recall that two nonzero vectors are perpendicular to each other if and only if their dot product is
0.) Hence, (a, b) is perpendicular to the line.
33.7 Use vector methods to find an equation of the line M through the point P,(2, 3) that is perpendicular to the line
L:jt + 2.y + 5 = 0.
_By Problem 33.6, A = (1,2) is perpendicular to the line L. Let P(x, y) be any point on the line M.
P,P = (x-2, y-3) is parallel to M. So, (x -2, y - 3) = c(l, 2) for some scalar c. Hence, x-2 = c,
y-3 = 2c. So, >>-3 = 2(x-2), y = 2x-l.
33.8 Use vector methods to find an equation of the line N through the points P,(l, 4) and P2(3, —2).
Let P(x,y) be any point onJV. Then P,P = (x -JU y -4) and P,P2 = (3-1,-2-4) = (2,-6).
Clearly, (6,2) is perpendicular to P,P2, and, therefore, to P,P. Thus, 0 = (6, 2) • (x - 1, y - 4) = 6(x  - 1) +
2( y - 4) = 6x + 2y - 14. Hence, 3x + y -1 = 0 is an equation of N.
33.9 Use vector methods to find the distance from P(2,3) to the line 3*+4y-12 = 0. See Fig. 33-1.
At any convenient point on the line, say ,4(4,0), construct the vector B = (3.4). which is perpendicular to
the line. The required distance d is the magnitude of the scalar projection of AP on B:

This derivation assumes a 5^0. If a = 0, a similar derivation can be given, taking A to be (0, -c/b).

[0 is (0,0), the zero vector.]

33.17 Given O(0,0), A(3,1), and B(l, 5) as vertices of the parallelogram OAPB, find the coordinates of P (see Fig.
33-4).
Let A = (3,1) and B = (l,5). Then, by the parallelogram law, OP = A + B = (3,1) + (1, 5) = (4, 6).
Hence, P has coordinates (4,6).
Fig. 33-4
33.18 Find k so that A = (3,-2) and B = (!,&) are perpendicular.
We must have 0 = A-B = 3-1 + (-2)- k = 3 -2k. Hence, 2k = 3, *=§.
33.19 Find a vector perpendicular to the vector (2, 5).
In general, given a vector (a, b), a perpendicular vector is (b, -a), since (a, b) • (b, -a) = ab - ab = 0. In
this case, take (5, -2).
33.20 Find the vector projection of A = (2, 7) on B = (-3,1).
By Problem 33.4, the projection is B = (-3,l)=A(-3,l) = (-tJs,&).
33.21 Show that A = (3,-6), B = (4,2), and C = (-7, 4) are the sides of a right triangle.
A + B + C = 0. Hence, A, B, C form a triangle. In addition, A-B = 3-4 + (-6)-2 = 0. Hence, A J_ B.
33.22 In Fig. 33-5, the ratio of segment PQ to segment PR is a certain number f, with 0<f<l. Express C in terms of
A, B, and t.
PQ = tPR. But, Ptf = B-A. So, C = A+P<2 = A + fP/? = A + r(B-A) = (l- r)A + rB.

33.23 Prove by vector methods that the three medians of a triangle intersect at a point that is two-thirds of the way from
any vertex to the opposite side.
See Fig. 33-6. Let O be a point outside the given triangle A ABC, and let A= OA, B = OB, C=OC.
Let M be the midpoint of side BC. By Problem 33.22, 0M=z(B + C). So, AM= OM - A = jr(B + C)-
A. Let P be the point two-thirds of the way from A to M. Then OP = A + § AM = A + f [ £ (B + C) - A] =
s(A + B + C). Similarly, if N is the midpoint of AC and Q is the point two-thirds of the way from B to N,
OQ= HA + B + C)=OP. Hence, P=Q.

33.26 Use vector methods to show that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other.
Let the diagonals of parallelogram PQRS intersect at W (Fig. 33-7). Let A = PQ, B = PS. Then
PR = A + B, SQ = \-B. Now, B = PW+ WS = PW- SW = xPR -ySQ = *(A + B) -y(\ - B) =
(jc — y)A. + (x + y)B, where x andy are certain numbers between 0 and 1. Hence, x — y=0 and x + y =
1. So, x = y=\. Therefore, PW= \PR and SW= \SQ, and the diagonals bisect each other.
33.27 Use vector methods to show that the line joining the midpoints of two sides of a triangle is parallel to and one-half
the length of the third side.
Let P and Q be the midpoints of sides OB and AB of &OAB (Fig. 33-8). Let A = OA and B = OB.
By Problem 33.22, OQ=|(A + B). Also, OF= |B. Hence, PQ = OQ - OP= |(A + B) - ^B = £A.
Thus, PQ is parallel to A and is half its length.
33.28 Prove Cauchy's inequality: |A • B| < |A| |B|.
Case 1. A = 0. Then |A-B| = |0-B| = 0 = 0- |B| = |0| |B|. Case 2. A^O. Let w = A-A and
i; = A-B, and let C = «B - t;A. Then, C-C = «2(B-B) -2au(A-B) + i>2(A- A) = u\B-B) - uv2 =
«[«(B-JJ)-i>2]. Since A^O, w>0. In addition, C-C>0. Thus, w(B-B)-u2>0, u(B-B)sir,
VwVB~ni>|t;|, |A||B|>|A-B|.
33.29 Prove the triangle inequality: |A + B| < |A| + |B|.
By the Cauchy inequality, |A + B|2 = (A + B)- (A + B) = A- A + 2A-B + B-B< |A|2 + 2|A| |B| + |B|2 =
(|A| + |B|)2. Therefore, |A + B| < |A| + |B|.
33.30 Prove |A + B|2 + |A - B|2 = 2(|A|2 + |B|2), and interpret it geometrically.
|A + B|2 + |A - B|2 = (A + B) • (A + B) + (A - B) • (A - B) = A • A + 2A • B + B • B + A • A - 2A • B + B • B =
2A • A + 2B • B = 2(|A|2 + |B|2). Thus, the sum of the squares of the diagonals of a parallelogram is equal to the
sum of the squares of the four sides.
33.31 Show that, if A-B = A-C and A¥=§, we cannot conclude that B = C.
If A-B = A-C, then A-(B-C) = 0. So, B-C can be any vector perpendicular to A; B-C
need not be 0.
33.32 Prove by vector method that the diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular.
Let PQRS be a rhombus, A - PQ, B= PS (see Fig. 33-9). Then |A| = |B|. The diagonal vectors
are W? = A + B and _SQ^\-B. Then /)/?-5Q = (A + B)-(A-B) = A-A + B-A-A-B-B-B =
|A|2-|B|2=0. Hence, PRLSQ.

33.33 Find the cosine of the angle between A = (1,2) and B = (3, -4).
A • B = |A| |B| cos 8. So, (1, 2)-(3, -4) = V3V25cos0, 3-8 = 5V5cos0, -l = V5cos0, cosfl =
-1 /V5 = -V5/5. Since cos 0 < 0, 0 is an obtuse angle.

By Problem 33.10, the distance is
33.35 Find A: so that the angle between A = (3,-2) and B = (1, k) is 60°.
A-B = |A||B|cos0, 3-2fc = 9 - 12* + 4k2 = % (I + k2), 36 - 48k + 16k2 = 13 + 13fc2
3fc2 - 48A: + 23 = 0, k =
33.36 Find k so that A = (3, -2) and B = (1, k) are parallel.
Let A = cB, (3, -2) = c(l, k), 3 = c and -2 = ck. Hence, -2 = 3k, fc=-§.
33.37 Prove that, if A is perpendicular to both B and C, then A is perpendicular to any vector of the form «B + vC.
A-B = 0 and A-C = 0. Hence, A-(MB + vC) = w(A-B) + u(A-C) = u -0 + v -0 = 0.
33.38 Let A and B be nonzero vectors, and let a = |A| and fo=|B|. Show that C = bA.+ aB bisects the angle
between A and B.
Since a>0 and b>0, C = (a + b)\ = (a + b)C* lies between A and B (see Fig.
33-10). Let 6l be the angle between A and C, and 62 the angle between B and C. Now, A-C =
A-(fcA+aB) = 6A-A+aA-B and B-C = B-(feA +«B) = 6A-B +aB-B. Then,
Likewise,
Hence, 0X = 02.

33.39 Write the vector A = (7, 3) as the sum of a vector C parallel to B = (5,-12) and another vector D that is

Note that C • D = = 0.

33.40 For nonzero vectors A and B, find a necessary and sufficient condition that A • B = |A| |B|.
A • B = |A| |B| cos 0, where 0 is the angle between A and B. Hence, A • B = |A| |B| if and only if
cos 0 = 1, that is, if and only if 6 = 0, which is equivalent to A and B having the same direction. (In other
words, A = «B for some positive scalar u.)

Note that x2 + y2 = a2 cos2 0 + a2 sin2 0 — a2(cos2 6 + sin2 0) = a2. Thus, we have a circle of radius a with
center at the origin. As shown in Fig. 34-1, the parameter 6 can be thought of as the angle between the positive

axis of length 2 along the x-axis (Fig. 34-2).
34.3 Sketch the curve with the parametric equations x = t, y = t2.
y = t2 = x2. Hence, the curve is a parabola with vertex at the origin and the y-axis as its axis of symmetry

34.7 Sketch the curve with the parametric equations x = sin t, y = cos 2t.
y = cos 2t = 1 — 2 sin21 = 1 — 2x2, defined for \x\ ^ 1. Thus, the curve is an arc of a parabola, with vertex at

bx = bxa + abt, ay = ay0 + abt. Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get bx — ay = bx0 —
ay0. This is a line through the point (x0, ya) and parallel to the vector (a, b), since (x, y) — (x0, y0) = t(a, b).
See Fig. 34-10.

Let x = at+a/4t, y = bt-b/4t. Then (x/a)2 = t2 + \ + l/l6t2, (y/b)2 = t2 - \ + l/16t2. Hence,
(x/a)2 — (y/b)2 = 1. Another possibility (cf. Problem 34.6) would be x = a sec u, y — b tan «.

Complete the square: x2 + (y -2)2 = 4. It suffices to have x = 2cosft y-2 = 2sinft So, let x =
2 cos ft, y = 2 + 2 sin ft
34.15 Sketch the curve given by the parametric equations x = cosh t, y = sinh t.
We know that cosh21- sinh21 = 1. Hence, we have x2-y2 = l. Since * = coshf>0, we have only
one branch of the hyperbola (Fig. 34-11).

34.16 Sketch the curve given by the parametric equations x =2cosh/, y = 3sinhf.
Since cosh2 t— sinh2 t = 1, = 1, = 1. Thus, we have one branch of a hyperbola,

34.20 Find the angle at which the cycloid x = a0 - a sin 0, y = a - a cos 0 meets the x-axis at the origin.
dxlde = a - a cos 0, dyldO-asmO. Hence, dy/dx = sin 01(1 - cos 0) = cot 6/2, lim cot (612} = +°°.
Therefore, the cycloid conies in vertically at the origin.

= t4 + 2ircos2irt, = l + e'. Hence, for t=l,
34.22 Find the slope of the curve x = t2+e', y = t+e' at the point (1,1).
dxldt = 2t + e', dyldt =1 + e'. Hence, The point (1,1) corresponds to the parameter
value t = 0. So, the slope is dy/dx = \=2.
34.23 Find dy/dx and d2y/dx2 for x = a cos3 0, y = a sin3 6.
dxlde = -3a cos2 0 sin 0. dyldd = 3a sin2 0 cos 0. So, Further,

34.24 Find the slope of x - e ' cos 2t, y = e 2t sin 2t at t = 0.
So,
dxldt = -2e ' sin It - e ' cos 2t, dyldt = 2e 2l cos 2t - 2e 2t sin 2t. At f = 0, dxldt = -1, dyldt = 2.
= -2.
34.25 Find the coordinates of the highest point of the curve x = 96t, y = 96t - 16t2.
We must maximize y. dy/dt = 96-32t, d2yldt2 = -32. So, the only critical number is t = 3, and, by
the second-derivative test, we have a relative (and, therefore, an absolute) maximum. When t = 3, x = 288,
y = 144.
34.26 Find an equation of the tangent line to the curve x = 3e', y = 5e ' at t = 0.
dxldt = 3e', dyldt = -5e~', At t = 0, dy/dx = -1, x = 3, y = 5. Hence,
the tangent line is y - 5 = - § (x - 3), 3y-l5 = -5x + 15, 5x + 3y - 30 = 0. Another method. At / = 0,
the tangent vector (dxldt, dyldt) = (3, -5), so the normal vector is (5, 3). Then, by Problem 33.6, the tangent
line is given by 5jc + 3y + c = 0, where c is determined by the condition that the point (x, y)l=0 = (3,5)
lies on the line.

34.27 Find an equation of the normal line to the curve x = a cos4 0, y- a sin4 0 at 0 = ir/4.
dx/dO = 4acos3 0(-sin0), dy/dO =4asin3 0(cos 0). At 0 = ir/4, dxldt=-a, dy/dO = a, giving as
tangent vector (-a, a) = —a(l,-1). So the normal line has equation x — y + c = 0. To find c, substitute
the values of x and y corresponding to 0 = Tr/4: - — ^ + c = 0 or c = 0.
34.28 Find the slope of the curve x = 3t-l, y = 9t2-3t when / = !.
dx/dt = 3, dy/dt = 18t-3. Hence, dy/dt = 6t-l = 5 when / = !.
34.29 For the curve of Problem 34.28. determine where it is concave upward.
A curve is concave upward where d2y/dx2 > 0. In this case, Hence, the
curve is concave upward everywhere.
34.30 Where is the curve x = In t, y = e' concave upward?
dxldt = \lt, dy/dt=e'. So, dy/dx = te', = e't(t + I). Thus, d2y/dx2>Q if and only
if f(t + l)>0. Since t>0 (m order for x-\nt to be defined), the curve is concave upward everywhere.
34.31 Where does the curve x = 2t2 — 5, y = t3 + t have a tangent line that is perpendicular to the line x + y +
3 = 0?
dx/dt = 4t, dy/dt = 3t2 + l. So, dy/dx = (3t2 + l)/4f. The slope of the line *+y+3=0 is-1, and,
therefore, the slope of a line perpendicular to it is 1. Thus, we must have dy/dx = 1, (3t2 + l)/4t = 1,
3t2 + l = 4t, 3f2-4r+l=0, (3t- l)(f- 1) = 0, t=\, or t = l. Hence, the required points are (-f, $)
and (-3,2).
34.32 Find the arc length of the circle x = acosO, y = asin0, 0<0^2ir.
Recall that the arc length
dx/d0 = -asinO, dy/d0 = acos0, and
the standard formula for the circumference of a circle of radius a.
34.33 Find the arc length of the curve x = e' cos t, y = e' sin <, from t = 0 to t= IT.
dxldt = e'(~sin t) + e'(cos t) = e'(cos t - sin t), (dx/dt)2 = e'(cos2 t - 2 sin t cos t + sin2 t) = e2'(l -
2 sin t cos t). dy/dt = e' cos t + e' sin t = e'(cos t + sin (), (dy/dt)2 = ez'(cos2 t + 2 sin t cos t + sin2 t) = e2'(l +
2 sin tcost). So, s = /; \/V(l - 2 sin t cos 0 + e2'(l + sin t cos 0 <fc = J0" V2er df = V2e' ]„ = V2(e" - 1).
34.34 Find the arc length of the curve x = | In (1 + t2), y = tan 11, from t = 0 to t = l.
dx/dt =t/(l + t2), (dxldt)2 = t2l(\ + t2)2. dy/dt = \l(\ + t2), (dyldt)2 = l/(\ + t2)2. Hence,
The substitution r = tan0, dt = sec20d0 yields Jo"'4sec 0 rf0 = In |sec 0 + tan 0\ Jo'4 = In |V2+ 1| -In 1 =
ln(V2+l).
34.35 Find the arc length of x = 2 cos 0 + cos 20 + 1, y = 2 sin 0 + sin 20, for 0 < 0 < 27r.
djc/dfl = -2 sin 0 - 2 sin 20, (dxlde)2 = 4(sin2 0 + 2 sin 0 sin 20 + sin2 20). dy/d0 = 2 cos 0 + 2 cos 20,
(rfy/d0)2 = 4(cos20 + 2cos0cos20 + cos220). So,
[Note that sin 0 sin 20 + cos 0 cos 20 = cos (20 -0) = cos0.] Since 1 + cos 0 = 2cos2(0/2), VI + cos 0 =
V2 |cos (0/2)|. Thus, we have: 2V2[J0" V2 cos (0/2) d0 + J2lr - V2cos (0/2) d0] = 4{2sin (0/2) ]J -

Problem 34.43, R'(t) = (dx/dt, dy/dt), since R(t) = (x(t), y(t)). Hence, |R'(Ol = ^J(dx/dt)2 + (dy/dt)2 =
dsldt, where s is the arc length along the curve (measured from some fixed point on the curve). But dsldt is the
speed. [The "speed" is how fast the end of the position vector R(f) is moving, which is the rate of change of its
position s along the curve.]
34.47 If R(s) is a vector function tracing out a curve and the parameter s is the arc length, show that the tangent vector
R'(s) is a unit vector, that is, it has constant length 1.

34.59 If |R(Ol 's a constant c>0, show that the tangent vector R'(0 is perpendicular to the position vector R(r).
Hence,
R(0-R(/) = |R(0|2 = c2- So, [R(f) • R(0] = 0. But, by Problem 34.57, [R(f)-R(r)] = R(0'R'(0 +
R'(0-R(0 = 2R(0-R'(0. R(0-R'(0 = 0.
34.60 Give a geometric argument for the result of Problem 34.59.
If |R(/)| = c?^0, then the endpoint of R(f) moves on the circle of radius c with center at the origin. At
each point of a circle, the tangent line is perpendicular to the radius vector.

34.66 Prove the converse of Problem 34.59.
By Problem 34.57, [R(0-R(0] = 2R(0'R'(0- Hence, R(/)-R'(/) = 0 implies R(r)-R(f) = c2 for
some positive constant c. Then |R(/)| = — c.
34.67 Give an example to show that if R(f) is a unit vector, then R'(0 need not be a unit vector (nor even a vector of
constant length).
Consider R(t) = (cos t2, sin t2). Then
|R(f)| = l. However, R'(f) = (-2t sin t2, 2t cos t2) and |R'(Ol = = 2\t\.
34.68 If F(w) = A for all u, show that F'(«) = 0, and, conversely, if F'(«) = 0 for all u, then F(«) is a constant
vector.
Let F(ii) = (/(«), g(«)). If A«) = «i and g(u) = a2 for all a, then F'(«) = (/'(«), g'(«)) =
(0,0) = 0. Conversely, if F'(«) = 0 for all u, then /'(«) = 0 and g'(u) = 0 for all u, and, therefore,
/(w) and g(u) are constants, and, thus, F(«) is constant.
34.69 Show that, if E^Q, then R(f) = A + tE represents a straight line and has constant velocity vector and zero
acceleration vector.
It is clear from the parallelogram law (Fig. 34-14) that R(t) generates the line «S? that passes through the
endpoint of A and is parallel to B. We have:
Further, R"(t) = dE/dt = 0.
Fig. 34-14
34.70 As a converse to Problem 34.69, show that if R'(«) = B ^ 0 for all «, then R(u) = A + uE, a straight line.
Let R(w) = (/(«), g(u)) and B = (bl,b2). Then f'(u) = bl and g'(u) = b2. Hence, /(«) =
fetM + a, and g(u) = b2u + a2. So, R(M) = (&,« + a,, 62w + a2) = A+ «B.
34.71 If R"(M) = 0 for all u, show that R(M) = A + uE, either a constant function or a straight line.
By Problem 34.68, R'(«) is a constant, B. If B = 0, then R(w) is a constant, again by Problem 34.68. If
B * 0, then R(M) has the form A + uE, by Problem 34.70.
34.72 Show that the angle 0 between the position vector R(0 = (e1 cos t, e' sin /) and the velocity vector R'(0 is ir/4.
I R(/) = e'(cost, sin t). By the product formula, R'(') = e'(-sin t, cos 0 + e'(cos t, sin t) = e'(cos t - sin /,
cosf + sinr)- Therefore, |R(f)| = e'\(cos t sin /)| = e' and |R'(OI = e'\(cos t - sin /, cos t + sin f)| =
(in agreement with dsldt = V2e' as
calculated in Problem 34.33). Now, R(r) • R'(0 = e'(cos t, sin f) • e'(cos t - sin t, cos r + sin /) = e2'(cos21 -
cos t sin / + sin / cos t + sin2 f) = e2'. But, R(f)-R'C) = |R(Ol |R'(Ol cos 0, e2'= e'• V2e'• cos 0, cos0 =

34.73 Derive the following quotient rule:

By the product rule,
34.74 Assume that an object moves on a circle of radius r with constant speed v > 0. Show that the acceleration
vector is directed toward the center of the circle and has length v2/r.
The position vector R(r) satisfies |R(f)l = f and IR'(')I = v- Let 0 be the angle from the positive x-axis to
R(f) and let 5 be the corresponding arc length on the circle. Then s = r6, and, since the object moves
with constant speed v, s = vt. Hence, 6 = vtlr. We can write R(r) = r(cos 6, sin 6). Bv the chain rule.
Again by the chain rule, R"(0 =

34.75 Let R(t) = (cos(7re'/2),sin(-7re72)). Determine R(0), v(0), and a(0), and show these vectors in a diagram.
Let thus,0 = -ne'12; R(t) = (cos 0, sine). By the chain rule, v(f) = R'(t) = (-sin 0, cos 6)
0(-sin0, cos 9), and
When andf = 0, 0=77/2, R(0) = (0,l),
See Fig. 34-15.
34.76 Let R(t) = (10cos27rf, 10sin27rf). Find the acceleration vector.
Fig. 34-15
Let 0 = 2irt. Then dO/dt = 2-n- and R(f) = 10(cos 0, sin 9). By the chain rule, v(f) = R'(0 =
10(-sin0, cos0) = 20Tr(-sin 6, cosO). By the chain rule again, the acceleration vector a(t) = d\/dt =
20ir(-cos 6, -sin 0) = -407r2(cos 0, sin 0) = -47r2RO). Note that this is a special case of Problem 34.74.
34.77 Let R(t) = (t,l/t). Find v(f), the speed |v(f)|, and a((). Describe what happens as f-*•+<».

i = (1,0), and the speed approaches 1. The acceleration vector always points along the positive y-axis, and its
length approaches 0.
34.78 Let R(t) = (t + cos t, t-sin t). Show that the acceleration vector has constant length.
R'(0 = (l -sinf, 1 -cosf), and R"(f) = (-cos t, sin t). Hence, |R"(')| =
34.79 Prove that, if the acceleration vector is always perpendicular to the velocity vector, then the speed is constant.
This follows from Problem 34.66, substituting R'(0 for R(t).

284 CHAPTER 34
34.80 Prove the converse of Problem 34.79: If the speed is constant, then the velocity and acceleration vectors are
perpendicular.
This is a special case of Problem 34.59 if we substitute R'(0 for R(r).
34.81 Let T(f) be the unit tangent vector to a curve R(t). Show that, wherever T(t) * 0, the principal unit normal
vector N = TV |T | is perpendicular to T.
The argument of Problem 34.59 applies to any differentiable vector function. Therefore, T • T' = 0, which
in turn implies T-N = 0 wherever N is defined (i.e., wherever |T'| >0).
34.82 Show that the principal unit normal vector N(f) (Problem 34.81) points in the direction in which T(f) is turning as t
increases.
Since N(t) has the same direction as T', we need prove the result only for T'. T'(0 =
For small Af, AT/Af has approximately the same direction as T'(0> and, when and
AT/Af have the same direction. If we place T(f + At) and T(f) with their tails at the origin, AT is the vector
from the head of T(f) to the head of 1(t + Af). Figure 34-16 shows that AT points in the direction in which T is
turning (to the right in this case).
Fig. 34-16
34.83 If R(t) = (r cos t, r sin t), where t represents time, show that the principal unit normal vector N(f) has the same
direction as the acceleration vector.
R'(<) = K-sin t, cos t) and |R'(Ol = '• So, T(f) = R'/|R'| = (-sin t, cost). Hence, T'(0 = (~cos/,
-sinf) and |T'(Ol = 1. Thus, N(r) =T'(0 = -(cos r.sin t) = - - R. In this case, by Problem 34.74, N(f)
has the same direction as the acceleration vector. Note that N(f) is pointing in the direction in which T(f) is
turning, that is, "inside" the curve.
34.84 Compute N(f) for the curve R(t) = (2 cos t2, 2 sin f2).
Thus,So, |R'(OI=4|<|.R'(0 = (~4f sin t2,4t cos r2) = 4r(-sin t2, cos t2).
Hence, So, and, therefore, N(f) =
T(f)/|T(f)| = — (cos t2, sin t2). Again, N(f) has the same direction as the acceleration vector, that is, it points
toward the center of the circle traced out by R(t).
34.85 Show that when arc length s is chosen as the curve parameter, the principal unit normal vector has the simple
expression N(s) = R"(s) I \R"(s)\.
By Problem 34.47, T(s) = R'(s), and so T'(s) = R"(s) and N(s) =T'(s)/|T(s)| = R"(s) /|R"(*)| [ex-
cept where R"(s) = 0].
34.86 Show that, for the cycloid R(() = a(t - sin t, 1 - cos t), where / is the time, the acceleration vector is not parallel
to the principal unit normal vector.

PARAMETRIC EQUATIONS, VECTOR FUNCTIONS, CURVILINEAR MOTION 285
and
Thus N(f) has the direction of (sin t, cos t- 1). However, the acceleration vector R"(f) = a(sin t, cos t).
34.87 At a given point on a curve, does the unit tangent vector depend on the direction in which the curve is being swept
out?
We let S(t) = R(-t). Then S(t) traces the same curve as R(f), but in the reverse direction. S'(t) =
-R'(-0 and |S'(0| = |R'(~Ol- Let T*(f) be the unit tangent vector for the curve S(r). Then T*(r) =
S'(0/|S'(Ol = ~R'(~0/IR'(-OI = -T(-f)- Hence, at each point, the direction of the unit tangent vector has
been reversed.
34.88 At a given point on a curve, does the principal unit normal vector depend on the direction in which the curve is
being swept out?
Use the same notation as in Problem 34.87. Let N*(/) be the principal unit normal vector on the reversed
curve S(0- Since T*(t) =-T(-t), -r T*(f) = T(-t), by the chain rule. Hence,
Thus, the principal unit vector is not changed by reversing the direction along a curve.
34.89 Let </> be the angle between the velocity vector and the positive ;t-axis. Show that \dT/dd>\ = 1.
Since T is a unit vector in the same direction as the velocity vector,
dT/d<t> = (-sin<f>, cos<f>) and \dT/d<l>\ = 1.
T = (cos <£, sin <t>). Hence,
34.90 Show that there is a scalar function /(r) such that N'(0 = f(t)T(t), and find a formula for /(/).
Parameterize the curve as R(<) = (t, t3).
Then
So, T'(0) = 0 and, therefore, N(0) is not denned.
34.91 Show that there is a scalar function/(r) such that N'(0 =/(0T(0> and nnd a formula for/(f).
Since N(t) is a unit vector, Problem 34.59 shows that N'(0 -I N(f). Since T(0 1 N(r), N'(0 and T(t)
must be parallel (remember that we are in two dimensions). Hence, there is a scalar function /(r) such that
T'N'(r)=/(r)T(0- Since N(()-T(0 = 0, the product rule yields N-T' + N'-T = 0, N'-T= - 7^71 •!" =
-|T'|. Hence, - |T'| = N''-T =/(/)T• T =f(t), since T-T = |T|2 = 1. When t = s = arc length, the
scalar / measures the curvature of R($); see Problem 34.105.
34.92 Show that
By the product rule,
T()t)=1/v R'(t).
286 CHAPTER 34
34.93 Generalize the result of Problem 34.83 to any motion at constant speed.
If dv/dt = 0, Problem 34.92 gives T' = (l/y)aor N = (l/u)|T'|a.
34.94 Define the curvature K and radius of curvature p of a curve R(f)-
As in Problem 34.89, let $ denote the angle between the velocity vector R'(') and the positive jr-axis. The
curvature K is defined as d<f>/ds, where s is the arc length. The curvature measures how fast the tangent vector
turns as a point moves along the curve. The radius of curvature is defined as p = |l//c|.
34.95 For a circle of radius a, traced out in the counterclockwise direction, show that the curvature is 1 la, and the radius
of curvature is «, the radius of the circle.
If (xa, y0) is the center of the circle, then R(t) = (x0 + a cos t, yg + a sin t) traces out the circle, where t is
the angle from the positive jc-axis to R(f) — (xa, y0). Then R'(0 = a(~sin t, cos t), and dsldt — a. The
angle <f> made by the positive *-axis with R'(f) is tan~l
Hence,
= tan ' (-cot t), or that angle + ir.
So, K = l/a, and by definition, the radius of curvature is a.
34.96 Find the curvature of a straight line R(f) = A + rB.
R'(f) = B. Since R'(0 is constant, $ is constant, and, therefore, K = d(f>/ds = 0.
34.97 Show that, for a curve y =/(*), the curvature is given by the formula K = y"/[l + (y')2]3'2. (We assume
that ds/dx>0, that is, the arc length increases with x.)
Since y' is the slope of the tangent line, tan <j> -y'. Hence, differentiating with respect to s,
sec2<t>(d<(>/ds) = y"/(ds/dx). But, sec2 <j> = 1 + tan2 4> = 1 + (y')2, and dsldx = [1 + (y')2]"2. Thus,
34.98 Find the curvature of the parabola y = x2 at the point (0,0).
y' = 2x and y" = 2. Hence, by Problem 34.97, K = 2/(l + 4x2)3'2. When x = 0, x = 2.

Use the formula of Problem 34.100, taking t to be 0. Then x = a(l -cos0), y = asin0, x = asin0,
y = a cos 6, (x)2 + (y )2 = a2(l - cos 0)2 + a2 sin2 0 = a\2 - 2 cos 0). Then

Use Problem 34.100. x = -3 cos21 sin t, y = 3 sin21 cos t, x = -3(cos31 - 2 sin21 cos t) =
-3 cos r(3 cos21 - 2). y = 3(-sin3 / + 2 cos21 sin 0 = 3 sin r(3 cos2 f - 1). [(x)2 + (.y)2]3'2 = (9 cos41 sin21 +
9 sin4 t cos2 O3'2 = (9 cos21 sin2 r)3'2 = 27 cos31 sin31. Now, xy - yx = (-3 cos21 sin 0(3 sin 0(3 cos2 t - 1) -
(3 sin21 cos 0(~3 cos 0(3 cos2 r - 2) = -9 cos21 sin2 f. *c = -9 cos21 sin2 f/27 cos31 sin3 t = - 1 /(3 cos f sin 0-

34.104 For what value of x is the radius of curvature of y = e* smallest?
y'=y" = e*. By Problem 34.97, K = e*l(\ + e2*)3'2, and the radius of curvature p is (1 + e2*)3'2/e*.
Then
Setting dpldx = Q, we find 2e2* = l, 2x = In | = -In 2, x=-(ln2)/2. The first-derivative test shows
that this yields a relative (and, therefore, an absolute) minimum.
34.105 For a given curve R(0, show that T"(0 = (v/p)N(t).
By definition of N(0, T'(0 = |T'(0|N(0- We must show that \T(t)\ = v/p. By the chain rule, T'(0 =
By Problem 34.89, Hence, |T'(Ol = \d<t>/dt\. But, and, therefore,
Since Thus,
34.106 Assume that, for a curve R(0, v = dsldt > 0. Then the acceleration vector a can be represented as the
following linear combination of the perpendicular vectors T and N: a = (d2s/dt2)T + (u2/p)N. The coefficients
of T and N are called, respectively, the tangential and normal components of the acceleration vector. (Since
the normal component v2/p is positive, the acceleration vector points "inside" the curve, just as N does.)
By definition of T, T = R'(0/"- So, R'(0 = vT. By the product rule, R"(0 = vT + (dv/dt)T. By
Problem 34.105, T' = (u/p)N. Hence, a = R"(0 = (d2s/dt2)T + (v2/p)N.
34.107 Find the tangential and normal components of the acceleration vector for the curve R(0 = (e', e2') (a motion
along the parabola y = x2).
Hence,
Since R" = (dv /dt)T + (u2/p)N,
\R"\2 = (dvldt)2 + (v2/p)2. Hence,
So,
and T and N are perpendicular, the Pythagorean theorem yields

288 CHAPTER 34
Thus, This is the normal component, and we already found the tangential component as
Note that we avoided a direct computation of v Ip, which is usually tedious.

R' = (2f, 3f2), R" = (2,6r) = 2(1,30- Then Hence,
By the Pythagorean theorem, |R'f = \dvldt\2 + (v2/p)2. Hence,
So,
tangential component as
is the normal component of the acceleration vector, and we already found the

x2 + y2 = r2 = a2. Hence, the graph is the circle of radius |a| with center at the pole.
35.10 Describe the graph of the polar equation 6 = trl4.
The graph is the line through the pole making an angle of ir/4 radian with the polar axis (Fig. 35-2). Note
that we obtain the points on that line below the *-axis because r can assume negative values.

35.11 Describe the graph of the polar equation 0 = 0.
This is simply the line through the polar axis, or the x-axis in rectangular coordinates.
35.12 Write a polar equation for the y-axis.
0 - ir/2 yields the line perpendicular to the polar axis and going through the pole, which is the y-axis.
35.13 Describe the graph of the polar equation r = 2 sin ft
Multiplying both sides by r, we obtain r2 = 2r sin 0, x2 + y2 = 2y, x2 + y2 - 2y = 0, x2 + (y - I)2 = 1.
Thus, the graph is the circle with center at (0,1) and radius 1.
35.14 Describe the graph of the polar equation r = 4 cos ft
Multiplying both sides by r, we obtain r2 = 4r cos ft x2 + y2 = 4x, x2 -4x + y2 = 0, (x - 2)2 + y2 = 4.
Thus, the graph is the circle with center at (2,0) and radius 2.
35.15 Describe the graph of the polar equation r = tan 0 sec ft
r = sin 0/cos2 ft r cos2 0 = sin ft r2 cos2 0 = r sin ft, x2 = y. Thus, the graph is a parabola.
35.16 Describe the graph of the polar equation r = 6/V9 — 5 sin2 ft
The graph is an ellipse.
r2 = 36/(9-5sin20), r2(9 - 5 sin2 ft) = 36, 9r2 - 5r2 sin2 0 = 36, 9(x2 + y2) - 5y2 = 36, 9*2 + 4/= 36,
35.17 Describe the graph of the polar equation r = -10 cos ft
Multiply both sides by r: r2 = -Wr cos 0, x2 + y2 = -10*, x2 + Wx + y2 = 0, (x + 5)2 + y2 = 25.
Thus, the graph is the circle with center (—5,0) and radius 5.
35.18 Describe the graph of the polar equation r = 6(sin 0 + cos 0).
Multiply both sides by r: r2 = 6r sin 0 + 6r cos ft x2 + y2 = 6y + 6x, x2 -6x + y2 -6y = 0, (AC - 3)2 +
(y - 3)2 = 18. Thus, the graph is the circle with center at (3,3) and radius 3V2.
35.19 Describe the graph of the polar equation r = 5 esc ft
r = 5/sin ft, r sin 0 = 5, y = 5. Thus, the graph is a horizontal line.
35.20 Describe the graph of the polar equation r = — 3 sec ft
r = —3/cos ft r cos 0 = —3, x = —3. Hence, the graph is a vertical line.
35.21 Change the rectangular equation x2 + y2 = 16 into a polar equation.
r2 = 16, r = 4 (or r=-4).
35.22 Change the rectangular equation x2 — y2 = 1 into a polar equation.
r2cos20-r2sin20 = l, r2(cos2 0 -sin2 0) = 1, r2cos20 = 1, r2 = sec2ft

35.23 Transform the rectangular equation xy = 4 into a polar equation.
r cosfl -rsin 0 = 4, r2 sin 0 cos 0 = 4, r2(sin20)/2 = 4, r2 = 8csc20.
35.24 Transform the rectangular equation x = 3 into a polar equation.
/•cos 6=3, r = 3secft
35.25 Transform the rectangular equation x + 2y = 3 into a polar equation.
rcos0 + 2rsin0 = 3, r(cos 0 + 2 sin 0) = 3, r = 3/(cos 0 + 2sin 0).
35.26 Find a rectangular equation equivalent to the polar equation 0 = 77/3.
tan 0 = tan (77/3) = VS. Hence, y/x = V3, y = V3x.
35.27 Find a rectangular equation equivalent to the polar equation r = tan 0.
~y/x, x2 + y2 = y2/x2, y2 = x2(x2 + y2), y2 = x* + x2y2, y2(l-x2) = x4, y2 = x</(l-x2).
35.28 Show that the point with polar coordinates (3,377/4) lies on the curve r = 3 sin 20.
Observe that r = 3, 0 = 377/4 do not satisfy the equation r = 3sin20. However (Problem 35.1), the
point with polar coordinates (3, 377/4) also has polar coordinates (—3, ?77/4), and r=— 3, 0 = 77r/4 satisfy
the equation r = 3sin20, since 3 sin 2(7 77/4) = 3sin(777-/2) = 3(-l) = -3.
35.29 Show that the point with polar coordinates (3,377/2) lies on the curve with the polar equation r2 = 9 sin 0.
Notice that r = 3, 0 = 3i7/2 do not satisfy the equation r2 = 9sin0. However, the point with polar
coordinates (3,377/2) also has polar coordinates (-3, 7r/2), and r = -3, 0 = 77/2 satisfy the equation
r2 = 9 sin 0, since (-3)2 = 9 • 1.
35.30 Sketch the graph of r = 1 + cos ft
See Fig. 35-3. At 0 = 0, r = 2. As 0 increases to 77/2, r decreases to 1. As 0 increases to 77, r decreases
to 0. Then, as 0 increases to 377/2, r increases to 1, and finally, as 0 increases to 2i7, r increases to 2. After
0 = 277, the curve repeats itself. The graph is called a cardioid.
Fig. 35-3 Fig. 35-4
35.31 Sketch the graph of r = 1 + 2 cos 0.
See Fig. 35-4. As 0 goes from 0 to 77/2, r decreases from 3 to 1. As 0 increases further to 277/3, r decreases
to 0. As 0 goes on to 77, r decreases to — 1, and then, as 0 moves up to 477/3, r goes back up to 0. As 0 moves on
to 377/2, r goes up to 1, and, finally, as 0 increases to 277, r grows to 3. This kind of graph is called a limacon.

The construction of the graph, Fig. 35-5, is indicated in the table of values. Note that some values of 0 yield
two values of r, and some yield none at all (when cos 20 is negative). The graph repeats from 6 = IT to
9 = 2ir. The graph is called a lemniscate.

35.33 Sketch the graph of r = sin 2ft
The accompanying table of values yields Fig. 35-6. The graph is called a four-leaved rose.
35.34 Sketch the graph of r = 1 - cos ft
The graph of r =/(0 - a) is the graph of r = f(6) rotated counterclockwise through a radians. Thus, a
rotation of Fig. 35-3 through IT radians gives the graph of r = 1 + cos (6 - ir) = 1 - cos ft
35.35 Sketch the graph of r = 1 - sin ft
Rotate Fig. 35-3 through 3ir/2 radians (or -IT 12 radians): r = 1+ cos (9 - 3ir/2) = 1 - sin ft
35.36 Sketch the graph of r = 1 + sin ft
Rotate Fig. 35-3 through ir/2 radians: r = 1 + cos (0 - tr/2) = 1 + sin ft
35.37 Sketch the graph of r2 - sin 2ft
Rotate Fig. 35-5 through ir/4 radians: r2 = cos 2(0 - ir/4) = cos (20 - -rr/2) = sin 2ft

Sketch the graph of r = sin 40.
Figure 35-14 shows an eight-leaved rose. Use increments of ir/8 in 0.
Fig. 35-14
Find the largest value of y on the cardioid r = 2(1 + cos 8).
y = r sin 6 = 2(1 + cos 0) sine. Hence, dy/dO = 2[(1 + cos 0) cos 0 - sin2 0]. Setting dy/d6 = Q, we
find (1 + cos 6) cos 6 = sin2 6, cos 0 + cos2 6 = 1 - cos2 0, 2 cos2 6 + cos 0 - 1 = 0, (2cos0 - l)(cos 0 + 1) =
0, cos 0 = \ or cos 0 = -1. Hence, we get the critical numbers it, ir/3,5ir/3. If we calculate y for these
values and for the.endpoints 0 and 2ir, the largest value 3V3/2 is assumed when 0 = ir/3.
Find all points of intersection of the curves r = I + sin2 0 and r= —1 — sin2 0.
If we try to solve the equations simultaneously, we obtain 2 sin2 0 = -2, sin2 0 = -1, which is never
satisfied. However, there are, in fact, infinitely many points of intersection because the curves are identical.
Assume (r,0) satisfies r=l+sin20. The point (r, 6) is identical with the point (-l-sin20, 6 + TT),
which satisfies the equation r=-l-sin20 [because sin2 (0 + IT) = sin2 01.
Find the points of intersection of the curves r = 4 cos 0 and r = 4V5 sin 0.
For the same (r, 0), 4V3sin 0 = 4cos 0, tan0 = l/V3, and, therefore, 0 = 77/6 or 6=7ir/6. So,
these points of intersection are (2V3, trl6) and (-2V5,7ir/6). However, notice that these points are identical.
So, we have just one point of intersection thus far. Considering intersection points where (r, 0) satisfies one
equation and (-r, 0 + IT) satisfies the other equation, we obtain no new solutions. However, observe that both
curves pass through the pole. Hence, this is a second point of intersection. (The curves are actually two
intersecting circles.)
Find the points of intersection of the curves r = V2 sin 0 and r2 = cos 20.
Solving simultaneously, we have 2 sin2 0 = cos 20, 2 sin2 0 = 1-2 sin2 0, 4 sin2 0 = 1, sin2 0 = J,
sin0 = ±|. Hence, we obtain the solutions 0 = 77/6,577/6,7-77/6,11 it 16, and the corresponding points
(V2/2, ir/6), (V2/2,5ir/6), (-V2/2,7ir/6), (-V2/2, llir/6). However, the first and third of these points are
identical, as are the second and fourth. So, we have obtained two intersection points. If we use (r, 0) for the
first equation and (-r, 0 + IT) for the second equation, we obtain the same pair of equations as before.
Notice that both curves pass through the pole (when r = 0), which is a third point of intersection.

From 4cos29 = 4sin20, we obtain tan20 = l, 20 = ir/4 or S-ir/4. The latter is impossible, since
4cos(57r/4)<0 and cannot equal r2. Hence, 0 = -rr/8, r2 = 2V2, r = ±23'4. Putting (-r, 6 + IT)
in the second equation, we obtain the same equation as before and no new points are found. However, both
curves pass through the pole r = 0, which is a third point of intersection.
Find the points of intersection of the curves r = 1 and r = -1,
As r = l and r=-l both represent the circle *2 + y2 = l, there are an infinity of intersection points.
Find the area enclosed by the cardioid r = 1 + cos 6.
As was shown in Problem 35.30, the curve is traced out for 0=0 to 0 = 2-n. The general formula for the

Find the area inside the inner loop of the limacon r = 1 + 2 cos 0.
Problem 35.31 shows that the inner loop is traced out from 0 = 5ir/6 to 0 = 7ir/6. So, the area
Find the area inside one loop of the lemniscate r2 = cos 20.
From Problem 35.32, we see that the area of one loop is double the area in the first quadrant. The latter area
is swept out from 6 = 0 to 0 = ir/4. Hence, the required area is
i(l-0)=|.

From Problem 35.33, we see that the area of one petal is swept out from 0=0 to 9 = ir/2.

35.60 Find the area inside the limacon r = l + 2 cos 0, but outside its inner loop.
From Problem 35.43, we see that the area is swept out from 0 = 0 to 6 = 2ir. Hence, the area is

From Problem 35.38, we see that the area is swept out from 0=0 to 0 = 2ir. So, the area is

U367r> = 187r.
From Problem 35.31, we see that it suffices to double the area above the *-axis. The latter can be obtained
by subtracting the area above the je-axis and inside the loop from the area outside the loop. Since the desired
area outside the loop is swept out from 0 = 0 to 0 = 2?r/3 and the desired area inside the loop is swept
out from 0=7r to 0 = 4ir/3, we obtain 2(i J02'/3 r2 dO - i J^17" r2 dO) = J"02"'3(l + 4cos 0 + cos2 0) dO -

(Zeno's paradox) Achilles (A) and a tortoise (7") have a race. T gets a 1000-ft head start, but A runs at 10 ft/s
while the tortoise only does 0.01 ft/s. When A reaches T's starting point, T has moved a short distance ahead.
When A reaches that point, T again has moved a short distance ahead, etc. Zeno claimed that A would never
catch T. Show that this is not so.
When A reaches T's starting point, 100 s have passed and T has moved 0.01 x 100 = 1 ft. A covers that
additional 1ft in O.ls, but T has moved 0.01 x 0.1 =0.001 ft further. A needs 0.0001 s to cover that distance,
but T meanwhile has moved 0.01 x 0.0001 = 0.000001 ft; and so on. The limit of the distance between A and
T approaches 0. The time involved is 100 + 0.1 + 0.0001 + 0.0000001 + • • • , which is a geometric series with
first term a = 100 and ratio r=-^. Its sum is 100/(1 - Tm). Thus, Achilles catches up with (and then

Describe the intersection of the graphs of x2 + y2 = 1 and z = 2.
As shown in Fig. 40-1, *2 + _y2 = l is a cylinder of radius 1 with the z-axis as its axis of symmetry. z = 2is
a plane two units above and parallel to the xy-plane. Hence, the intersection is a circle of radius 1 with center at
(0,0, 2) in the plane z = 2.
Let P = (*,, _y,, zj, Q = (x2, y2, z2), R = (x3, y3, z3). Assume (5,-1,3) is the midpoint of PQ,
(4,2,1) is the midpoint of QR, and (2,1,0) is the midpoint of PR. Then, (x1+x2)/2 = 5, (x2 + -v3)/2 = 4,
and (xl+x3)/2 = 2. So, xt+x2 = 10, x2 + x*, = 8, and .*! + *3 = 4. Subtract the second equation
from the first: xt— x3 = 2, and add this to the third equation: 2xt = 6, xl = 3. Hence, x2 = 7. *3 = 1.
Similarly, y,+y2 = -2, y2 + y, = 4, yl+y, = 2. Then, y,-y3 = -6, 2y, =-4, yl = -2. So,

If B x C = 0, what can be concluded about B and C?
|B x C| = |B| |C| sin 0, where 0 is the angle between B and C. So, if B x C = 0, either B = 0 or
C = 0 or sin 0 = 0. Note that sin 0 = 0 is equivalent to B and C being parallel; in other words, linearly
dependent.
If A • (B x C) = 0, what can be concluded about the configuration of A, B, and C?
One possibility is that B x C = 0, which, by Problem 40.46, means that B = 0 or C = 0 orB and
C are parallel. Another possibility is that A = 0. If A ^ 0 and B x C * 0, then A • (B x C) = 0
means that A 1 (B x C), which is equivalent to A lying in the plane determined by B and C (and therefore not

where A = (a,, a2, a3), B = (bl, b2,b3), C = (c,, c2) c3).
By Problem 40.40, the cofactors of the first row are the respective components of B x C.
If A x B = A x C and A ^ 0, does it follow that B = C?
No. AxB = AxC is equivalent to A x (B - C) = 0. The last equation holds when A is parallel to
B-C, and this can happen when B^C.
If A, B, C are mutually perpendicular, show that A x (B x C) = 0.
B x C is a vector perpendicular to the plane of B and C. By hypothesis, A is also such a vector and,
therefore, A and B x C are parallel. Hence, A x (B x C) = 0.
Verify that B x A = - (A x B).
Let A = (a1,a2,a3) and E = (bl,b2,b3). Then A x B = (a2b3 — a3b2, a3bl — alb3, alb2 — a2bl) and
B x A = (b2a3 - b,a2, b,a, - bta3, b,a2 - &,«,) = - (A x B).

By Problem 40.52, A x A = - (A x A).
Verify that ixj = k, jxk=i, and kxi=j.
i x j = (1,0,0) x (0,1,0) = (0(0) - 0(1), 0(0) - 1(0), 1(1) - 0(0)) = (0,0,1) = k. j x k = (0,1,0) x (0,0,1)
= (1(1)-0(0), 0(0)-0(1), 0(0)-l(0)) = (l,0,0) = i. Finally, kx i = (0,0,1) x (1,0,0) = (0(0) - 1(0),
1(1)-0(0), 0(0) -0(1)) = (0,1,0) =j.
Show that A • (B x C) = (A x B) • C (exchange of dot and cross).
(A x B) • C = C • (A x B) = A • (B x C). The first equality follows from the definition of the dot product; the
second is established by making two row interchanges in the determinant of Problem 40.49.

A-(BxC) + B-(CxA), since, for all D and E, D-(DxE) = 0 and D-(ExD) = 0. Hence, we obtain

A x B = (a2b, - a3b2, a3bl - atb,, atb2 - a2bt) and C x D = (c2d3 - c3d2, c3dl - ctd3, ctd2 - c2dt).
So, (A x B) • (C x D) = (a2b3 - a3b2)(c2d3 - c3d2) + (a3b, - a,fc3)(c3d1 - <:,</,) + (atb2 - fl2&,)M2 - c2d,) =

Prove (A - B) x (A + B) = 2(A x B).
(A-B)x(A + B) = (Ax A) + (AxB)-(BxA)-(BxB). Since AxA = BxB = 0 and BxA =

Show that C x (A x B) is a linear combination of A and B; namely, C x (A x B) = (C • B)A - (C • A)B.
A x B = (a2b3 - a3b2, a3br - a,b3, a,b2 - a2ft,). So, C x (A x B) = (c2(a,b2 - a^,) - c3(a3bl - a,63),
C3(a2b3 - a3b2) - c,(a,b2 - a2bt), c^b, - atb3) - c2(a2b3 - a3b2)) = (qfc, + c2b2 + c3b3) (a,, a2, a3) -

A, B, C, when the given points are not coplanar. If those points are coplanar, either B x C = 0, and,
therefore, A-(BxC) = 0; or BxC^O and A is perpendicular to B x C (because A is in the plane of B and

If 0>, and 2P2 were parallel, s£ and 38 would have to be parallel. But A and B are not parallel (since A is not a

Find an equation of the plane containing the point ^,(3, —2,5) and perpendicular to the vector N = (4, 2, -7).
For any point P(x, y, z), P is in the plane if and only if P,,P 1 N, that is, if and only if P.P-N =

Find an equation of the plane containing the point />,(4,3, -2) and perpendicular to the vector (5, -4,6).
We know (from Problem 40.80) that the plane has an equation of the form 5x — 4y + 6z = d. Since P, lies
in the plane, 5(4) — 4(3) + 6(-2) = d. So, d = — 4 and the plane has the equation 5x - 4y + 6z = -4.
Find an equation for the plane through the points P(l, 3,5), Q(-l, 2, 4), and R(4,4,0).
is normal to the plane. N = (-2, -1, -1) x (3,1, -5) = (6, -13,1). So, the equation has
the form 6* - 13y + z = d. Since R is in the plane, 6(4) - 13(4) + 0 = d, d = —28. Thus, the equation is
6x - I3y + z = -28.
Find an equation for the plane through the points (3,2, -1), (1, —1,3), and (3, -2,4).
We shall use a method different from the one used in Problem 40.82. The equation of the plane has the form
ax + by + cz = d. Substitute the values corresponding to the three given points: (1) 3cz + 2b - c = d;
(2) a-b + 3c = d; (3) 3a-2b + 4c = d. Eliminating a from (1) and (2), we get (4) 5b-lOc=-2d.
Eliminating a from (2) and (3), we get (5) b — 5c = —2d. Eliminating d from (4) and (5), we get
5b-Wc = b-5c, 4b = 5c, b=\c. From (5), -2rf=|c-5c, d=$c. From (2), a = d + b-3c =
ifc+ jc-3c = c/8. So, the equation of the plane is (c/8)x + %cy + cz = ^c. Multiplying by 8/c yields
x + Wy + Sz = 15.
Find the cosine of the angle 6 between the planes 4x + 4_y-2z=9 and 2x + y + z =-3.
0 is the angle between the normal vectors (4,4, -2) and (2,1,1). So,
Of course, there is another angle between the planes, the supplement of the angle whose cosine was just found.
The cosine of the other angle is -cos 6 = —5V6/18.
Find parametric equations for the line 2£ that is the intersection of the planes in Problem 40.84.
The line «SPis perpendicular to the normal vectors of the planes, and is, therefore, parallel to their cross product
(4,4, —2) x (2,1,1) = (6, —8, —4). We also need a point on the intersection. To find one, set x = 0 and
solve the two resulting equations, 4y — 2z = 9, y + z = -3. Multiplying the second equation by 2 and
adding, we get 6y = 3, y=\. So, z = -\. Thus, the point is (0, 3,-1) and we obtain the line x=6t,
y= i -8t, z--\-*t.
Find an equation of the plane containing the point P( 1,3,1) and the line !£: x = t, y - t, z = t + 2.
The point Q(0,0,2) is on the given line .5? (set r = 0). The vector = (1,3,-1) lies in the
sought plane. Since the vector (1,1,1) is parallel to &, the cross product (1,3,—l)x(l,l,l) =
(4, -2, —2) is normal to the plane. So, an equation of the plane is 4* — 2y — 2z = d. Since the point
Q(0,0, 2) is in the plane, -4 = d. Thus, the plane has the equation 4x - 2y - 2z = —4, or 2x — y — z =
-2.

Since & and 0\ are parallel, the normal vector (1, -2,2) of 0\ is also a normal vector of 0". Hence, an
equation of 9 is x-2y + 2z = d. Since the point (1, -1,2) lies on 9, l-2(-l) + 2(2) = d, d = l. So, an
equation of S^ is x - 2y + 2z = 7.
Consider the sphere of radius 3 and center at the origin. Find the coordinates of the point P where the plane
tangent to this sphere at (1, 2,2) cuts the x-axis.
The radius vector (1,2, 2) is perpendicular to the tangent plane at (1, 2,2). Hence, the tangent plane has an
equation of the form x + 2y + 2z = d. Since (1,2,2) is in the plane, 1 + 2(2) + 2(2) = d, d = 9. So, the
plane has the equation x + 2y + 2z = 9. When y=0 and z = 0, x = 9. Hence, the point Pis (9,0,0).
Find the value of k for which the planes 3x — 4v + 2z + 9 = 0 and 3x + 4y — kz + 7 = 0 are perpendicular.
The planes are perpendicular if and only if their normal vectors (3, —4, 2) and (3,4, — fc) are perpendicular
which is equivalent to (3, -4, 2) -(3,4, -k) = 0, 9-16-2fc = 0, k=-\.
Check that the planes x — 2y + 2z = 1 and 3* - y — z = 2 intersect and find their line of intersection.
Since the normal vectors (1, -2,2) and (3, -1, —1) are not parallel, the planes are not parallel and must
intersect. Their line of intersection 3! is parallel to the cross product (1,-2,2) x (3,-1,-1) = (4,7,5). To
find a point on ££, set x = 0 in the equations of the planes: -2y + 2z = 1, -y - z = 2. Multiply the second
equation by 2 and add: -4y = 5, y = -i, z = -1. So, the point (0, -\, -f) is on .2", and £ has the
equations x = 4t, y = — f + It, z = — f + 5t.
Show that the two sets of equations
and
represent the same straight line.
The point (4,6, —9) lies on the first line, and substitution in the second system of equations yields the
equalities (4 - l)/(-6) = (6 - 2)/(-8) = (-9 - 3)/24. So, the two lines have a point in common. But the
denominators of their equations represent vectors parallel to the lines, in the first case, (3,4, -12) and, in the
second case, (-6, -8,24). Since (-6, -8,24)= -2(3,4, -12), the vectors are parallel. Hence, the two
lines must be identical.
Find an equation of a plane containing the intersection of the planes 3x — 2y + 4z = 5 and 2x + 4y — z = 7
and passing through the point (2,1,2).
We look for a suitable constant k so that the plane (3x - 2y + 4z - 5) + k(2x + 4y - z - 7) = 0 contains
the given point. Thus, (3 + 2k)x + (-2 + 4k)y + (4 - k)z - (5 + 7k) = 0 must be satisfied by (2,1,2):
(3 + 2fe)2 + (-2 + 4k) + (4 - k)2 - (5 + Ik) = 0, - k +1 = 0, k = 7. So, the desired plane is 17* + 26y -
3z-54 = 0.
Find the coordinates of the point P at which the line

cuts the plane 3* + 4y + 5z =
Write the equations of the line in parametric form: x = -8 + 9t, y = 10 - 4t, z = 9 - 2t. Substitute in
me equation for the plane: 3(-8 + 9t) + 4(10 - 4f) + 5(9 - 2t) = 76. Then, t + 61 = 76, t = 15. Thus, the
point P is (127, -50, -21).
Show that the line lies in the plane 3x + 4y -5z = 25.
The equations of the line in parametric form are x = 3 + 5t, y = — 1 + 5t, z = — 4 + It. Substitute in the
equation of the plane: 3(3 + 5t) + 4(-1 + 5t) - 5(-4 + It) = 25, 0(t) + 25 = 25, which holds identically in t.
Hence, all points of the line satisfy the equation of the plane.

parallel to their cross product (1, —1,2) x (2,3, 6) = (-12, -2, 5). Hence, the required equations are x =
4-12?, y = 2-2t, z = -l + 5t.
Find an equation of the plane through P(l, 2, 3) and parallel to the vectors (2,1, -1) and (3, 6, -2).
A normal vector to the plane is (2,1, —1) x (3,6, ^2) = (4,1,9). So, the plane has an equation of the
form 4x + y + 9z = d. Since (1,2, 3) lies in the plane, 4 + 2 +27 = d, d = 33. So, the equation is 4x +
y + 9z = 33.
Find an equation of the plane through (2, -3,2) and the line 3!determined by the planes 6x + 4y + 3z + 5 = 0
and 2* + _y + z-2 = 0.
Consider the plane (6x + 4y + 3z + 5) + k(2x + y + z - 2) = 0. This plane passes through X. We want
the point (2,-3,2) to be on the plane. So, (12- 12 + 6 + 5) + fc(4-3 + 2-2) = 0, ll + fc = 0, A: =-11.
Therefore, we get 6x + 4y + 3z + 5 - 11(2* + y + z - 2) = 0, -I6x -7y - 8z + 27 = 0, 16x + 7y + 8z -
27 = 0.
Find an equation of the plane through P0(2, —1, —1) and P^l, 2, 3) and perpendicular to the plane 2x + 3y —

is parallel to the plane. Also, the normal vector (2, 3, -5) to the plane 2x + 3y - 5z -
6 = 0 is parallel to the sought plane. Hence, a normal vector to the required plane is (-1, 3, 4) x (2,3, -5) =
(-27,3,-9). Thus, an equation of that plane has the form -27* + 3y - 9z = d. Since (1,2, 3) lies in the
plane, -27 + 6-27 = d, d=-48. Thus, we get -27* + 3y - 9z = -48, or 9* - y + 3z = 16.

Find the points at which the line intersects the ellipsoid
The line can be written in parametric form as x = 6 + 3t, y = —2 — 6f, z = 2 + 4t. Hence, substituting in

4f)2 = 324, 26(36/2) +26(360+ 4(81) = 324, t2 + t = 0, t(t+l) = 0, t = 0 or <=-!. So, the points are

Give the equations connecting rectangular and cylindrical coordinates of a point in space
For a point with rectangular coordinates (x, y, z), corresponding cylindrical coordinates are (r, 0, z), where
r2 = x2 + y2 and tanO = y/x. Conversely, ;t = rcos0 and y = rsin0. Thus, (r, 0) are "polar" coordi-
nates corresponding to (x, y).
Describe the surface with the cylindrical equation r = k.
When k ^0, this is the equation of a right circular cylinder with radius \k\ and the z-axis as axis of

Since y is constant in the plane y = 5, the slope of the tangent line to the curve is dzldx. By implicit

(\, \, V2/2), dzldx= -jc/z = -4/(V2/2)= -1/V2= -V2/2.

PARTIAL DERIVATIVES 379
The plane through (1,1,1) and parallel to the Jtz-plane is y = l. The slope of the tangent line to the
resulting curve is dzldx = 6x = 6. The plane through (1,1,1) and parallel to the yz-plane is x = 1. The
slope of the tangent line to the resulting curve is dzldy = 8y = 8.
42.29 Find equations of the tangent line at the point (—2,1,5) to the parabola that is the intersection of the surface
z = 2x2 - 3y2 and the plane y-l.
The slope of the tangent line is dzldx = 4x= —8. Hence, a vector in the direction of the tangent line is
(1,0, -8). (This follows from the fact that there is no change in y and, for a change of 1 unit in x, there is a
change of dzldx in z.) Therefore, a system of parametric equations for the tangent line is x = 2 + t, y = 1,
z = 5-8t (or, equivalently, we can use the pair of planes y = I and 8x + z = -ll).
42.30 Find equations of the tangent line at the point (—2,1,5) to the hyperbola that is the intersection of the surface
z = 2x2 — 3y2 and the plane z = 5.
Think of y as a function of x and z. Then the slope of the tangent line to the curve is dyldx. By implicit
differentiation with respect to x, 0 = 4x - dy(dyldx). Hence, at (-2,1,5), 0 = -8 - 6(dyldx), dyldx = -\.
So, a vector in the direction of the tangent line is (1, - f, 0), and parametric equations for the tangent line are
x=— 2+t, y = l— ff, z = 5 (or, equivalently, the pair of planes 4x + 3y = — 5 and z = 5).
42.31 Show that the tangent lines of Problems 42.29 and 42.30 both lie in the plane Sx + 6y + z + 5 = 0. [This is the
tangent plane to the surface z = 2x2 - 3y2 at the point (-2,1,5).]
Both lines contain the point (-2,1,5), which lies in the plane ty: 8x + 6y + z + 5 = 0, since 8(-2) +
6(1)+ 5+ 5 = 0. A normal vector to the plane is A = (8,6,1). [A is a surface normal at (-2,1,5).] The
tangent line of Problem 42.29 is parallel to the vector B = (l,0, —8), which is perpendicular to A [since
A • B = 8(1) + 6(0) + l(-8) = 0]. Therefore, that tangent line lies in the plane &. Likewise, the tangent line of
Problem 42.30 is parallel to the vector C = (l, -j,0), which is perpendicular to A [since A-C = 8(1) +
6(— |) + 1(0) = 0]. Hence, that tangent line also lies in plane 9. (We have assumed here the fact that any line
containing a point of a plane and perpendicular to a normal vector to the plane lies entirely in the plane.)
42.32 The plane y — 3 intersects the surface z = 2x2 + y2 in a curve. Find equations of the tangent line to this
curve at the point (2,3,17).
The slope of the tangent line is the derivative dzldx = 4x = 8. Hence, a pair of equations for the tangent
line is (z - 17) l(x - 2) = 8, y = 3, or, equivalently, z = 8x + 1, y = 3.
42.33 The plane x = 3 intersects the surface z = x2l( y2 - 3) in a curve. Find equations of the tangent line to this
curve at (3,2,9).
The slope of the tangent line is Hence, a pair of equations for the tangent
line is (z-9)/(y-2) =-36 and x = 3, or, equivalently, z--36y + sl, x = 3. [Another method is
to use the vector (0,1,—36), parallel to the line, to form the parametric equations x = 3, y = 2+t,

The normal vectors are (2ax,2by, — 1). Hence, the normal line at (xg, y0, h) has parametric equations
x = xa + 2ax0t, y = y0 + 2by0t, z = h — t. This line hits the *y-plane when z = 0, that is, when t=h.
Thus, the point of intersection is x = x0 + 2ax0h = x0(l + 2ah), y = y0 + 2by0h = y0(l + 2bh). Note that
Hence, the desired equation is

42.118 Give an expression for a tangent vector to a curve <£ that is the intersection of the surfaces F(x, y, z) = 0 and
G(*,y,z)=0.
A normal vector to the surface F(x, y,z) = 0 is A = (Fx, Fy, Fz), and a normal vector to the surface
G(x, y, z) = 0 is B = (G^, Gy, Gz). Since the curve is perpendicular to both A and B, a tangent vector would
be given by
42.119 Find equations of the tangent line to the curve that is the intersection of x2 + 2y2 + 2z2 = 5 and 3x-2y —
z = 0 at (1,1,1).
By Problem 42.118, a tangent vector is
or, more simply, (2,7, —8). Hence, equations for the tangent line are x = 1 + 2t, y = 1 + It, z = 1 —8t.
42.120 Write an equation for the normal plane at (x0, y0, z0) to the curve <€ of Problem 42.118.
If (x, v, z) is a point of the normal plane, the vector C = (x — x0, y — y0, z — z0) is orthogonal to the tangent
vector A x B at (xa, y0, z0). Thus, the normal plane is given by
where the derivatives are evaluated at (xa, v0, z0).

By Problem 42.120, an equation is
or
42.122 Show that the surfaces x2 + y2 + z2 = 18 and xy = 9 are tangent at (3, 3,0).
We must show that the surfaces have the same tangent plane at (3,3,0), or, equivalently, that they have
parallel normal vectors at (3,3,0). A normal vector to the sphere x2 + y2 + z2 = 18 is (2x, 2y, 2z) —
(6,6,0). A normal vector to the cylindrical surface xy=9 is (y, x,0) = (3,3,0). Since (6,6,0) and
(3, 3, 0) are parallel, the surfaces are tangent.
42.123 Show that the surfaces x2 + y2 + z2 - 8x - 8y -6z + 24 = 0 and x2 + 3y2 + 2z2 = 9 are tangent at (2,1,1).
The first surface has normal vector (2x - 8, 2y - 8, 2z - 6) = (-4, -6, -4), and the second surface has
normal vector (2x, 6y, 4z) = (4,6,4). Since (4, 6,4) and (—4, —6, —4) are parallel, the surfaces are tangent at
(2,1,1).
42.124 Show that the surfaces x2 + 2y2 - 4z2 = 8 and 4x2 - y2 + 2z2 ='14 are perpendicular at the point (2,2,1).
It suffices to show that the tangent planes are perpendicular, or, equivalently, that the normal vectors are
perpendicular. A normal vector to the first surface is A = (2x, 4y, — 8z) = (4, 8, — 8), and a normal vector to
the second surface is B = (8*, -2y,4z) = (16, -4,4). Since A-B = 4(16) + 8(-4) + (-8)4 = 0, A and B
are perpendicular.
42.125 Show that the three surfaces yt: I4x2 + lly2 + 8z2 = 66, y2: 3z2 - 5* + y = 0, y,: xy + yz-4zx = 0

A normal vector to 5^, is A = (28*, 22y, 16z) = (28,44,16). A normal vector to 5^2 is B = (-5, l,6z) =
(-5,1,6). A normal vector to Zf3 is C = (y -4z, .* + z,y -4x) = (-2,2, -2). Since A-B = 0, A-C = 0,
and B • C = 0, the normal vectors are mutually perpendicular and, therefore, so are the surfaces.

Directional Derivatives and the
Gradient. Extreme Values
43.1 Given a function/(je, y) and a unit vector u, define the derivative of/in the direction u, at a point (*„, y0), and
state its connection with the gradient Vf = (fx, /v).
The ray in the direction u starting at the point (*0, ya) is (x0, y0) + tu (t > 0). The (directional) derivative, at
(x0, y0), of the function / in the direction u is the rate of change, at (xa, y0), of / along that ray, that is,
— /((*„, y0) + tu), evaluated at t = 0. It is equal to Vf • u, the scalar projection of the gradient on u. (Similar
definitions and results apply for functions / of three or more variables.)
43.2 Show that the direction of the gradient Vfis the direction in which the derivative achieves its maximum, \Vf\, and
the direction of — Vf is the direction in which the derivative achieves its minimum, — \Vf\.
The derivative in the direction of a unit vector u is Vf • u = \Vf \ cos 0, where 6 is the angle between Vf and
u. Since cos 6 takes on its maximum value 1 when 0=0, the maximum value of Vf-v is obtained when u
is the unit vector in the direction of Vf. That maximum value is |V/|. Similarly, since cos 0 takes on its minimum
value —1 when 0 = rr, the minimum value of Vf-u is attained when u has the direction of —Vf. That
minimum value is — \Vf\.
43.3 Find the derivative of f(x, y) = 2x2 - 3xy + 5y2 at the point (1, 2) in the direction of the unit vector u making
an angle of 45° with the positive ;t-axis.
Hence, the deriva-
tive is V/-u = (-2,17)-(V2/2,V2/2) =
u = (cos45°, sin 45°) = (V2/2, V2/2). Vf = (4x -3y, -3x + lOy) = (-2,17) at (1,2).
43.4 Find the derivative of f(x, y) = x — sin xy at (1,77/2) in the direction of u =
V/=(l -ycosxy, -x cos xy) = (1,0). Hence, the derivative is V/-u= |(1,0)-(1, V5) = f.
43.5 Find the derivative of f(x, y) = xy2 at (1, 3) in the direction toward (4, 5).
The indicated direction is that of the vector (4,5) - (1, 3) = (3, 2). The unit vector in that direction is
u = (l/vT3) (3,2); the gradient Vf=(y2,2xy) = (9,6). So, V/-u = (9,6)-
43.6 Find the derivative of f(x, y, z) = X2y2z at (2,1,4) in the direction of the vector (1,2,2).
The unit vector in the indicated direction is u= 1(1,2,2). Vf= (2xy2z, 2x2yz, x2y2) = (16,32, 64) =
16(1, 2,4). Hence, the derivative is Vf- u = 16(1,2,4) • $(1, 2,2) = ^(13) = ^.
43.7 Find the derivative of f(x, y, z) = x* + y3z at (-1,2,1) in the direction toward (0, 3, 3).
A vector in the indicated direction is (0,3,3) - (—1,2,1) = (1,1, 2). The unit vector in that direction is
Hence, is
43.8 On a hill represented by z = 8 - 4x2 - 2y2, find the direction of the steepest grade at (1,1,2).
In view of Problem 43.2, we wish to find a vector v in the tangent plane to the surface at (1,1, 2) such that the
perpendicular projection of v onto the xy-plane is Vz = (-8*, -4y) = (-8, -4). Thus we must have v =
(-8, -4, c); and the component c may be determined from the orthogonality of v and the surface normal found
in Problem 42.105: (-8, -4, c)-(-8, -4, -1) = 0 or c = 80
Note that the direction of v is the direction of steepest ascent at (1,1, 2).
392

DIRECTIONAL DERIVATIVES AND THE GRADIENT 393
43.9 For the surface of Problem 43.8, find the direction of the level curve through (1,1) and show that it is
perpendicular to the direction of steepest grade.
The level curve z = 2 is 8 - 4x2 - 2v2 = 2, or 2x2 + y2 = 3. By implicit differentiation, 4jc +
dyldx = -2x/y = -2. Hence, a tangent vector is (1, -2,0). A vector in the direction of steepest
grade is (-8,-4,80), by Problem 43.8. Because (-8,-4, 80) •(!,-2,0) = 0, the two directions are perpen-
dicular.
43.10 Show that the sum of the squares of the directional derivatives of z =/(*, y) at any point is constant for any
two mutually perpendicular directions and is equal to the square of the gradient.
This is simply the Pythagorean theorem: If u and v are mutually perpendicular unit vectors in the plane, then
Problem 33.4 shows that Vf=(Vf-u)u + (Vf-v)v. A direct computation of Vf'Vf then gives |V/|2 =
(Vf-u)2 + (Vf-v)2.
43.11 Find the derivative of z = x In v at the point (1, 2) in the direction making an angle of 30° with the positive
x-axis.
The unit vector in the given direction is
So, the derivative is

43.13 If the temperature is given by f(x, y, z) = 3x2 - 5y2 + 2z2 and you are located at (3, |, |) and want to get
cool as soon as possible, in which direction should you set out?
V/= (6*, -Wy, 4z) = (2, -2, 2) = 2(1, -1,1). The direction in which/decreases the most rapidly is that of
-V/; thus, you should move in the direction of the vector (-1,1, -1).
43.14 Prove that the gradient VFof a function F(x, y, z) at a point P(x0, y0, z0) is perpendicular to the level surface of F
going through P.
Let F(x0, y0, z0) = k. Then the level surface through P is F(x, y, z) = k. By Problem 42.109, a normal
vector to that surface is (Fx, Fy, F2), which is just VF.
43.15 In what direction should one initially travel, starting at the origin, to obtain the most rapid rate of increase of the
function f(x, y, z) = (3 - x + y)2 + (4x - y + z + 2)3?
The appropriate direction is that of V/= (/,, fy, f:) = (2(3 - x + y)(-l) + 3(4* - y + z + 2)2(4), 2(3 -
x + y) + 3(4* -y + z + 2)2(-1), 3(4* - v + z + 2)2) = (42, -6,12) = 6(7, -1,2).
43.16 If fix, y, z) = jc3 + y3 - z, find the rate of change of/at the point (1,1, 2) along the line

A vector parallel to the given line is (3,2, -2). Since the first component, 3, is positive, the vector is pointing
in the direction of increasing x. Hence, we want the opposite vector (-3, -2,2). A unit vector in that direction
is Hence, the required rate of change is

43.22 If z =f(x, y) has a relative maximum or minimum at a point (x0, y0), show that Vz = 0 at (x0, y0).
We wish to show that both partial derivatives of z vanish at (xg, ya). The plane y = y0 intersects the
surface z=f(x, y) in a curve z=f(x, y0) that has a relative maximum (or minimum) at x = xa. Hence,
dz/dx = Q at (x0, ya). Similarly, the plane x - x0 intersects the surface z = f(x, y) in a curve z =

43.24 Using the assumptions and notation of Problem 43.23, give examples to show that case 3, where A = 0, allows
no conclusions to be drawn.
Each of the functions /,(*, y) = x4 + y4, f2(x, y) = -(x4 + y4), and /,(*, y) = x3 - y3 vanishes at
(0,0) together with its first and second partials; hence A(0,0) = 0 for each function. But, at (0,0), /, has a

43.25 Find the relative maxima and minima of the function f(x, y) = 2x + 4y — x2 — y2 - 3.
f, = 2-2x, fy=4-2y. Setting /, =0, £ = 0, we have jr = l, y = 2. Thus, (1,2) is the only
critical point. /x,=0, /„ =-2, and fyy = -2. So, A=/^/vv -(fxy)2 = 4>0. Since /„+/„ =-4<0,
there is a relative maximum at (1,2), by Problem 43.23.

DIRECTIONAL DERIVATIVES AND THE GRADIENT
43.26 Find the relative maxima and minima of f(x, y) = x3 + y3 - 3xy.
t = 3x2 - 3y, fy = 3y2 - 3x. Setting f, = 0, fy = 0, we have x2 = y and / = x. So, / = y
and, therefore, either y = 0 or y = l. So, the critical points are (0,0) and (1,1). fxy = -3, /„ = 6*,
fyy=6y. At (0,0), &=f,xfyy ~(f,y)2 = -9<0. Therefore, by Problem 43.23, there is neither a relative
maximum nor a relative minimum at (0,0). At (1,1), A = 36-9>0. Also, /„+/„, = 12>0. Hence, by
Problem 43.23, there is a relative minimum at (1,1).
43.27 Find all relative maxima and minima of f(x, v) = x2 + 2xy + 2y2.
Setting £ =0, fy = 0, we get x + y = 0, * + 2y = 0, and, therefore, x = y = 0. Thus, (0,0) is the
only critical point—the only possible site of an extremum.

have 2xy = 1 + y2, 2xy = l + x2. Therefore, 1 + y2 = 1 + x2, y2 = x2, y = ±x. Hence, ±2x2 = 1 + x2.
-2x2 = l + x2 is impossible. So, 2x2 = l + x2, x2 = l, * = ±1. Thus, the critical points are (1,1),
(1,-!),(-!, !),(-!,-1). fxy = -2x + 2y, /„ = ~2y, fyy=2x. Hence, A = -4xy -4(y - x)2. For
(1,1) and (-1,-1), A=-4<0. For (1,-1) and (-1,1), A=-12<0. Hence, by Problem 43.23, there
are no relative maxima or minima.
43.29 Find all relative maxima and minima of f(x, y) = 2x2 + y2 + 6xy + Wx - 6y + 5.
x=4x + 6y + 10, fy=2y + 6x-6. Setting /j = 0 and fy = 0, we get 2x + 3y + 5 = 0 and 3* +
y - 3 = 0. Solving simultaneously, we have x = 2, y = -3. Further, fxy = 6, fxx = 4, fyy = 2. So,
A =f%xfyy ~ (fxy)2 = -28 <0. By Problem 43.23, there is no relative maximum or minimum.

£ =0, f y= 0, and then subtracting, we get (y - x)(\8 -x-y) = 0. Since z = 18-x-v>0, y-x = 0,
that is, y = x. Substituting in I8y - 2xy - y2 = 0, we find that y = 6. Hence, x = 6 and z = 6.

/„ = 132, A = (28)( 132) - (36)2 = 2400 > 0. /„ + /„ = 160 > 0. Thus, by Problem 43.23, we have a relative
minimum and, by geometric intuition, we know it is an absolute minimum. Substitution of

Also, /„ = 36, f =28,
Since f(x, y) = (x + y)2 + y2 a 0, there is an absolute minimum 0 at (0,0). fx = 2x + 2y, fy=2x + 4y.

Write the first line in parametric form as x = 2 + 4t, y = —1 —It, z = -1 + t, and the second line as

y>0, z>0, y + z<20. fy = 20z2 - 2yz2 - z3, f, = 40yz - 2y2z - 3yz2. Set fy = 0, /z=0. Then,
z2(20 - 2y - z) = 0 and yz(40 - 2y - 3z) = 0. Since y > 0 and z > 0, 20 - 2y - z = 0 and 40 - 2y -
3z = 0. Solving these equations simultaneously, we obtain y=5, z = 10. Hence, ;c = 5. This point
(5, 5,10) yields an absolute maximum (by an argument similar to that given in Problem 43.32).

4z = 0. Subtracting, we get 12 - 2z = 0, z = 6. Hence, y = 4 and x = 2. That this point yields the

Instead of following the solution to Problem 43.32, let us apply the theorem of the means (Problem 43.51):
yz2 = (20 - y — z)yz2 = 20yz2 — y2z2 - yz3. We must maximize this function f(y, z) under the conditions
We must maximize /(y, z) = (12-y - z)yV = 12y2z3 - y3z3 - y2z4 subject to the conditions y+z<

2yz = 2*z + xy and 2*z + 2yz = 2yz + xy, and, therefore, z = x/2 and z = y/2. Substitute in xy +
2xz + 2yz = 108. Then 4z2 + 4z2 + 4z2 = 108, 12z2 = 108, z2 = 9, z = 3. Hence, x = 6, y = 6. Therefore,

(xy-l)y = 0 and y + (xy - l)x = 0. Hence, x2 + xy(xy - 1) = 0 and y2 + xy(xy - 1) = 0. Therefore,
x2 = y2, x = ±y. Substitute in x + (xy - l)y = 0, getting x + x3 ± x - 0. Hence, x3 = 0 or x(x2 + 2) = 0.
In either case, x = 0, y = 0, z = —1. By geometric reasoning, there must be a minimum. Hence, it must
be located at (0, 0, -1).

The volume We can think of c as a function of a and b, and, therefore, of V as a function of a and b.
Thus, Since the plane contains (1,1,2), Hence,

Differentiating the equation of the ellipsoid, we get and
Thus, and Hence, and
Set VX = V=0. Then z = cV/za2, z = c2y2/zb2. Therefore, x2/a2 = x2/c2 = y2/b2.
The equation of the ellipsoid now gives: x = a/V3, z = c/V3, y = bN 3, and V= 8abc/3V3.

y) + y(l20 - * - y) = *y + 120* - x2 - xy + 120y - xy - y2 = 120* + 120y - x2 - xy - y2. fx = 120 - 2x - y,
fy = 120 - * - 2y. Set f,=fy=Q and solve: 120 - 2x - y = 0, 240 - 2x - 4y = 0. Hence, 120 - 3y = 0,
y = 40, x = 40. Thus, the division is into three equal parts. Note that fxy = -l, fxjt = -2, fyy = -2, A = 4-
1 = 3 > 0, and /„ + fyy = -4 > 0. Hence, the critical point (40, 40) yields a relative maximum /(40, 40) =
4800. To see that this is an absolute maximum, observe that the continuous function f(x, y) must have an
absolute maximum on the closed triangle in the first quadrant bounded above by the line x + y = 120 (Fig.
43-2). The only possibility for an absolute maximum inside the triangle occurs at a critical point, and (40,40) is
the only such point. Consider the boundary of the triangle. On the lower leg, where y = 0, f(x, 0) =
*(120-*) = 120*-*2, with 0<*<120. The critical number of this function turns out to be 60. /(60, 0) =
3600 < 4800 = /(40,40). The endpoints * = 0 and * = 120 yield 0 as the value of/. Similarly, the other
leg of the triangle, where * = 0, gives values of/less than/(40, 40). Lastly, on the hypotenuse of the triangle,
where * + y = 120, /(*, y) = *y = *(120 —*), with 0^*sl20, and the same analysis as above shows
that the values of / are less than /(40,40). Hence, (40, 40) actually does give an absolute maximum. Another
method: 2(xy + xz + yz) = (x + y + z)2 - (x2 + y2 + z2) = 1202 - (x2 + y2 + z2). By Problem 43.36 the abso-
lute minimum of x2 + y2 + z2 over the plane * + y + z — 120 = 0 is attained at x = y = z = 40.

Substituting in the equation of the plane, we have 3(-|y + 5) -4y + (-y + 10) + 32 = 0,
So, the closest point in the plane is

can be checked against the formula obtained in Problem 40.88.)

g(x0, y0) = 0 and / has an extreme value at (*„, y0) relative to all nearby points that satisfy the "constraint"
g(x,y) = 0, and if Vg(*0, y0)^Q, then V/(x0, y0) = A Vg(x0, y0) for some constant A (called a Lagrange
multiplier). Thus, the points at which extrema occur will be found among the common solutions of g(x, y) = 0
and V/=AVg [or, equivalently, V(/-Ag) = 0]. Similar results hold for more than two variables.
Moreover, for a function f(x, y, z) and two constraints g(x, y, z) = 0 and h(x, y, z) = 0, one solves

The constraint is g(x, y, z) = 4x + 2iry + 3z - L = 0. VA = (2x, 2iry, (V5/2)z) and Vg = (4, 2ir, 3). Let
VA = \Vg, that is, (2x,2Try, zV3/2) = A(4, 2ir, 3), or 2* = 4A, 27ry=2A7r, zV3/2 = 3. Hence, x = 2A,

45.1 For the space curve R(t) = (t, t, t ), find a tangent vector and the tangent line at the point (1,1, 1).
A tangent vector is given by the derivative R'(t) = (l,2t,3t ). At (1,1,1), <=1. Hence, a tangent
vector is (1, 2, 3). Parametric equations for the tangent line are x = 1 + w, y = 1 + 2a, z = 1 + 3w. As a

45.3 Find the normal plane to the curve of Problem 45.1 at t = \.
The tangent vector at t = l is (1,2,3). That vector is perpendicular to the normal plane. Since the
normal plane contains the point (1,1,1), its equation is \(x - 1) + 2(y - 1) + 3(z - 1) = 0, or equivalently,
x + 2y + 3z = 6.
45.4 Find a tangent vector, the tangent line, the speed, and the normal plane to the helical curve R(t) =
(a cos 2irt, a sin 2irt, bt) at f = l.
A tangent vector is R'(Q = (-2ira sin 2irt, 2-rra cos 2irt, b) = (0, 2-rra, b). The tangent line is (a,0, b) +
u(0, 2TTd, b). The speed is R'(0l = V4?r V + b2. The normal plane has the equation (0)(;e - a) +
(2trd)(y - 0) + (b)(z - b) = 0, or equivalently, 2-rray + bz = b2.

By Problem 45.11, [R(0 x R'(01 - [R(f) x R"(t)l + [R'(f) x R'(f)l. But A x A = 0 for all A.
Hence, the term R'(/) x R'(/) vanishes.
If G'(0 is perpendicular to G(f) for all t, show that |G(f)| is constant, that is, the point G(t) lies on the surface of £
sphere with center at the origin.
Since G'(0 is perpendicular to G(r), G'(f) • G(t) = 0. Then
G'(0 ' G(f) = 0 + 0 = 0. Therefore, |G(r)|2 is constant, and hence |G(f)| is constant.

[R(0 • R(r)] = R(f) • R'(/) + R'(0' R(0 = 2R(0 • R'(0- Therefore, R(r)-R'(0=0 at t = t0. Since
R(0^0 and R'(r)^0, R(t) 1 R'(0 at t = ta.
Assume that R(f) ^ 0 and R'(f)-^0 for all t. If the endpoints of R(f) is closest to the origin at t = t0,
show that the position vector R(t) is perpendicular to the velocity vector R'(0 at f = t0. [Recall that, when t is
the time, R'(') is called the velocity vector.)
Let |G(/)| = c for all t. Then G(t)-G(t) = |G(f)|2 = c2 So
G(0-G'(0 + G'(0'G(r) = 0. Thus, 2G(r)-G'(0 =0, and, therefore, G(f)-G'(f) = 0.
[G(0-G(0] = 0. Hence,

Find an equation of the osculating plane to the curve R(/) = (2t - t2, t2,2t + t2) at <=1.
The osculating plane is the plane determined by T and N; hence, the binormal vector B = T x N is a normal
vector to the osculating plane. R'(0 = (2 - 2t, 2t, 2 + 2t). |R'(r)| = V4(l - t)2 + 4t2 + 4(1 + t)2 = 2\/3r + 2.
Thus, Hertce,
andAt
Since T is parallel to R' and N is parallel to T', a normal
vector to the osculating plane is given by (0, 2,4) x (-5, 2, -1) = (-10, -20,10) = -10(1, 2, -1). Therefore,
an equation of the osculating plane at (1,1, 3) is (x - 1) + 2(y — 1) - (z - 3) = 0, or equivalently, x + 2y —
z = 0.

45.22 Prove the following formula for the curvature:
Find the curvature of R = (e1 sin /, e' cos t, e') at t = 0.
R = e'(sin r, cos t, 1). Hence, R' = e'(cos t, -sin f, 0) + e'(sin t, cos /, 1) = e'(cos t + sin t, cos t -
sint, 1); R"=e'(2cost, -2sin/,l). At t = 0, R'= (1,1,1) and R" = (2,0,1). Hence, R'x R" = (1,1,-2),
|R'xR"| = V6, and |R'| = V3. By Problem 45.22,
K|R'|3(T x N) = fo|RT(T x N). Since |T x N| = 1, it follows that |R' x R"| = K|RT.
Therefore,
Note thatHence, Hence,
45.21 Find the curvature K of the curve R(t) - (sin f, cos /, at t = 0.
First, R' = (cos f, -sin t, t), and
Hence, and
andtherefore,
The osculating plane is the plane determined by T and N. Let D = R' x R". Now, Hence,
Since D • R' = 0 and D • R" = 0, it follows that D • T' = 0. Thus, D is per-
pendicular to R' and to T', and, therefore, to T and to N. Hence, D is a normal vector to the osculating plane.
Find an equation of the osculating plane of the curve R(f) = (3>t2,1 - t, t3) at (12, —1, 8) corresponding to
f = 2.
R'(0 = (6f, -I,3f2) = (12, -1,12), and R"(r) = (6,0,60 = (6,0,12). Hence, R' x R" = (12, -1,12) x
(6, 0,12) = (-12, -72,72) = -12(1, 6, -6). By Problem 45.19, -12(1, 6, -6), or more simply (1, 6, -6), is a
normal vector to the osculating plane. Hence, an equation of that plane is x — 12 + 6(y + 1) — 6(z — 8) = 0,
or equivalently, x + 6y — 6z + 42 = 0.

The auxiliary equation is M2 + 2a + l=0, with the repeated root « = -!. By Problem 46.48, the general
solution of (2) is y = (C, + C2Oe '. Since x = e', t = lnx. Hence,

46.74 Solve the linear third-order equation with constant coefficients y'" — 7y" + 16y' — 12y = 0.
The auxiliary equation is «3 — 7«2 + 16u - 12 = 0. 2 is a root. Division by u — 2 yields w2 — 5u +
6 = (u- 2)(u - 3). Thus, 2 is a repeated root and 3 is a root. So, by an extension of Problem 46.48, the general
solution is Cle3' + (C2 + C3x)e2'.
The auxiliary equation is u3 + 2u2 — u -2 = 0. 1 is a root. Division by u — 1 yields u + 3u + 2 =
(u + l)(u + 2). Thus, the three roots are 1, -1, and -2. Hence, by an extension of Problem 46.48, the general
solution is C le' + C2e~* + C3e~2*. (The method of variation of parameters also extends to inhomogeneous

46.78 Find a linear differential equation with constant coefficients satisfied by e2', e *, e3*, and e5*.
The auxiliary equation should have 2, —1,3, and 5 as roots: (u - 2)(u + l)(u - 3)(w - 5) = w4 - 9w3 +
21w2 + w - 30. Hence, the required equation is y<4) - 9y'" + 21y" + y' - 30y = 0.
46.77 Solve y(4) + 4y'" + lOy" + 12y' + 9y = 0.
The auxiliary equation is «4 + 4w3 + 10M2 + 12a +9 = 0. This factors into (u2 + 2u + 3)2, with double
roots -1±V2/. Then, instead of e~*[Ct cos(V2;c) + C2 sin (V2x)], the general solution is
e"'[(Cl + C2x) cos (V2x) + (C3 + C4x) sin (V2x)].
46.76 Solve y(4)-4y"' + 9y"-10y' + 6y = 0.
The auxiliary equation is w4 - 4u3 + 9u2 - 10w + 6 = 0. This can be factored into (u2 - 2w + 3)(w2 -
2« + 2). The first factor has roots 1 ± V2t, and second factor has roots 1 ± i. Hence, by an extension of
Problem 46.48, the general solution is e*[C, cos (V2x) + C2 sin (V2x)] + e'(C3 cos x + C4 sin x).
e ~l stems from a root -2 of the auxiliary equation, e* cos 2x comes from the complex conjugate
roots 1 + 2/ and 1 - 2i. Thus, we get the auxiliary equation (u + 2)[u - (1 + 2i)][u - (1 - 2/)] = (M +
2)(u2 — 2u + 5) = u3 + u + 10 = 0. Hence, the required equation is y'" + y' + lOy = 0.
